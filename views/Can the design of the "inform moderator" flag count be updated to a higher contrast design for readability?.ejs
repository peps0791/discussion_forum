				<h2>Can the design of the "inform moderator" flag count be updated to a higher contrast design for readability?</h2>
<p>I'm seeing this on the report to moderator box:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0wNRB.png" alt="The number of inform moderator flags remaining is too dark to read"></p>

<p>Can the design of the "inform moderator" flag count be updated to a higher contrast design for readability? The black text on a dark red background is not very readable.</p>

<p><em>Chrome 25 (dev) on Mac OS X 10.8</em></p>

				<p>Thanks for raising this - I've pinged the developer on the old thread. Would you propose something specific to fix is - is it a contrast issue or a colorblind issue or a sizing issue in your estimation?</p>

				<p>For me this is a contrast issue. If the text was white that would help immensely. AFAIK I'm not colorblind :)</p>

				<p>black on red is indeed not usually very readable, at all.</p>

				<p><p>That old post was about an alignment issue, not a color issue. Your screenshot clearly shows that it was indeed fixed.</p>

<p>That doesn't make <em>your</em> issue any less valid though, so this will be fixed as well after the next build (It turns out that red wasn't the intended background color here).</p>

				<p>Re-read the old post. You are absolutely right. Fixed the question accordingly.</p>
