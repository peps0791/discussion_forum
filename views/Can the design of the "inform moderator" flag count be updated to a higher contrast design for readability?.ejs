<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0wNRB.png" alt="The number of inform moderator flags remaining is too dark to read"></p>

<p>Can the design of the "inform moderator" flag count be updated to a higher contrast design for readability? The black text on a dark red background is not very readable.</p>

		<p>That old post was about an alignment issue, not a color issue. Your screenshot clearly shows that it was indeed fixed.</p>

<p>That doesn't make <em>your</em> issue any less valid though, so this will be fixed as well after the next build (It turns out that red wasn't the intended background color here).</p>
