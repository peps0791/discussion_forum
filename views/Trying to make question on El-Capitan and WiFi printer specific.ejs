	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>I have an issue with my WiFi printer after upgrading my OS. I'm trying to understand/isolate (and ultimately resolve) the issue, however, I am not getting anywhere. The only question to post here that I can come up with, I myself would likely VtC as "Too Broad". But I am struggling with clarifying it.<br>
<strong>Should I ask anyway, or consult a discussion forum instead?</strong></p>

<p>Here's my situation:</p>

<ul>
<li>I use a Brother HL-2270DW printer which connects to the home WiFi.  </li>
<li>Previous to upgrading to OS X El Capitan on my 2009 MacBook, I had no issues using the printer.  </li>
<li>After upgrading the OS, the printer was gone from the list of available printers.  </li>
<li>The only way to add it to the list was specifying the IP address of the printer. Only then was it detected and correctly identified.  </li>
<li>But: I can only ever print once. On any subsequent job, the printer cannot be connected. I can delete it and add it again to the list and it will print - once.  </li>
<li>Adding the printer by inputting the IP address for every single document is too tedious for me.  </li>
</ul>

<p>However, as stated above, I do not know how to tackle this. And asking for trouble-shooting advice appears "too broad". </p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>The recipe for asking about troubleshooting is pretty easy once you've seen it work.</p>

<p>Everything is in the help section on how to ask a good question.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask">https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Just show your exact search terms on what you looked for and be narrow about the issue. You want to focus people on asking how to determine if a printer supports bonjour or how to set up a printer so that you don't have to use an IP address.</p>

<p>Using chat or a discussion forum might help you winnow down what you really are asking. Also, sometimes just "how can tell if printer XYZ should be discoverable by OS X version ABC" with you documenting what search you did on Apple and Brother's site makes it answerable.</p>
