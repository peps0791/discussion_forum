				<h2>Xcode questions</h2>
<p>we are seeing some Xcode questions. Some are about the code being written and so are off topic here. However some are about keys to use e.g. <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/85766/is-there-a-hand-tool-for-xcodes-storyboard-scrolling-without-scrollbars-pdf-s">here</a> and so are on topic here. However there are more Xcode users on Stack Overflow should we migrate these questions to Stack Overflow?</p>

				<p>How does SO react to tool use questions? I'm not experienced enough with SO to know. If they're inclined to close tool use questions because they're not strictly about **programming** I'd say no, leave them here (assuming they're getting the care and attention they need here of course).</p>

				<p>@IanC. Tool use questions are explicitly on topic for StackOverflow - see the FAQ which says "software tools commonly used by programmers"</p>

				<p>I'd only migrate something if it wasn't getting attention here, otherwise it's on topic and a-okay to stay here.</p>

				<p><p>If a question is on-topic here, it remains open. If it is off-topic, it gets closed. On-topic or off-topic, nothing gets migrated unless the OP requests is.</p>

<p>There are a number of questions that would be on-topic at more than one SE site. This is not a bug. If a question is asked here and it is on-topic here, here it is.</p>

				<p>If off topic could the mods please also note that they will migrate it if asked not just close it.</p>

				<p>No. Migration is not a feature I'm interested in advertising. I moderate this site, and don't particularly know or care what's on topic on other sites.</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-3067" class = "comment">
				<p>So a user will cut and paste a question from here to another so we get two questions - surely that is not an outcome we want</p>

				<p>If someone requests migration, I'm willing to migrate, but as I said, I don't know or care what's on topic on sites other than Ask Different, so I'm not about to suggest migration to a site where I don't know what they want. From your account information, @Mark, it's clear you understand Super User and Stack Overflow. You're welcome to suggest migration where it's appropriate. I'm not qualified to do that. Also, more often than not, a question closed as off-topic here wouldn't be a good fit AS ASKED on other sites; while off-topic is an easy close reason, such questions usually need more work.</p>

			<div id = "comment-3082" class = "comment">
				<p>@Mark - In general, closing a question can sometimes result in migration, but not always. As a mod on another site, I always prefer it when other sites *ask us* before migrating a question; it sometimes saves us having to close a bad question when it arrives, which can be somewhat dizzying for new users.</p>

				<p><p>Broadly speaking Xcode is Apple software so any questions relating to the use of Xcode (key combinations, window handling etc.) clearly are on-topic enough to have a place in AD. There are enough developers hanging out here to help in answering these kind of questions.</p>

<p>This also means that for questions about Xcode usage both SO and AD might be the "right" place to ask. I don't think this will lead to any problems though, it's up to the asker to put the question onto whatever site he prefers (and hopefully not on both at once).</p>
