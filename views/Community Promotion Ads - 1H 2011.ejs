<h3>What in the Wide, Wide World of Sports is Going On Here?</h3>

<p>TL;DR -- put images and links in the answers. If they get voted up enough, they will appear on the main site as community promotion ads.</p>

<h3>But whyyyyyyy?</h3>

<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>cool apple related open source apps</li>
<li>the site's twitter account</li>
<li>scripts packs or power tools</li>
<li>cool events or conferences</li>
<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. And to click on it for great justice!</p>
