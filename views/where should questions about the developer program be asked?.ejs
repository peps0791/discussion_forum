				<h2>where should questions about the developer program be asked?</h2>
<p>I had a question about what happens to my apps if the development program is not extended.</p>

<p>Then my question was voted down and closed since this was not the place to ask this question according to the FAQ of this site.</p>

<p>But where should questions like these be asked?
I also think that the answer of this question should be included in the FAQ of askdifferent.</p>

<p>I've read <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/213/should-questions-about-the-developers-side-of-the-app-store-be-considered-on-or">this</a> question on meta askDifferent but that question is more about if the question is on topic or not.</p>

				<p>This site is the place where questions about using Apple products and all apple programs <strong><em>except for iTunes Connect</em></strong>.</p>

<p>I personally want to build consensus (if there is actual consensus) to broaden that scope to allow iTunes connect questions <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/51084/iphone-app-now-is-pending-contract-will-it-be-removed-from-the-itunes-store">like the one you asked</a>.</p>

<p>Your question isn't complicated, is covered in Apple's FAQ that isn't something under NDA (although much of the mechanics of developing is under NDA - and most developers do not hang out here).</p>

<p>The only place I see for you to ask this topic currently is on Stack Overflow - but again, it's not a great fit in my eyes. I believe they prefer hard programming questions - not soft program and policy questions.</p>

<hr>

<p>In any event - as a developer, you have email, phone and web support from Apple - so even if your account has lapsed, you can sign up for a free tier of access and still have a point to ask them about the mechanics of the program.</p>

<p>Please do weigh in on the discussion over here and in the chat room if you want to change things here (either for or against changing the FAQ)</p>
