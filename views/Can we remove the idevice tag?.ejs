				<h2>Can we remove the idevice tag?</h2>
<p>I recently ran across the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/idevice" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;idevice&#39;" rel="tag">idevice</a> tag and was wondering if we could purge that out. Currently there is only one question tagged <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/idevice" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;idevice&#39;" rel="tag">idevice</a>.<br>
I do not think we need this tag, as it is too broad. Tags are meant to narrow down to topics, not such broad overarching tags. <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ios" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;ios&#39;" rel="tag">ios</a> also already covers this, as do the specific tags <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/iphone" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;iphone&#39;" rel="tag">iphone</a> <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ipad" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;ipad&#39;" rel="tag">ipad</a> <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ipod" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;ipod&#39;" rel="tag">ipod</a> <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ipod-touch" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;ipod-touch&#39;" rel="tag">ipod-touch</a>.<br>
Secondly, <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/idevice" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;idevice&#39;" rel="tag">idevice</a> is not a word. You never see Apple referring to their product lines with <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/idevice" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;idevice&#39;" rel="tag">idevice</a>.<br>
Based on this, can we purge this tag from the system, and/or create a synonym  to <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ios" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;ios&#39;" rel="tag">ios</a>?</p>

<p>Yes, please. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>  create a synonym to iOS?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>idevice</em> is not a word (agreed), so there's no need for it to be a synonym of anything. </p>

				<p>It's gone (for now). Ping us if it surfaces again after the 24 hour period needed to clean it up now that no questions are using that tag.</p>
