	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>In chat today, <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/12285/timothy-mueller-harder">Timothy</a> mentioned that the tags in oneboxes look a lot like the buttons in Windows XP:</p>

<p>Compare to Windows XP button:<br>

<p>Can we make the oneboxes <em>and</em> the tags on the main site look like the buttons from Lion? Like this:<br>

I personally think that this will add more personality and a more OS X-ish feel to the site.</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>I feel this would be a very poor design decision. </p>

<p>Apple's HIG specifically calls out "<strong><em>Do not use a push button as a label</em></strong>."</p>

<p>The OS X button style is reserved for clickable UI elements and if we used them on items that are not Cocoa controls and instead web links - I feel it would undermine the clarity of purpose that <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/Intro/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000894-TP6" rel="nofollow noreferrer">OS X provides under it's Human Interface Guidelines</a>. <em>And that's the best spin on it for people browsing from OS X browsers.</em></p>

<p>It <strong>gets worse</strong> if you are browsing from an <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/Introduction/Introduction.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">iOS device</a> where the button treatment uses another idiom. Likewise Ubuntu, Windows, Android, etc .</p>

<p>I get the wish to have pretty things - but I'd personally rather a "design is how it works" interpretation here over a "design is how it looks" design.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the site has redesigned the tag buttons and they look very nice on both retina and non-retina screens of all OS (<em>again perhaps only in my opinion</em>).</p>
