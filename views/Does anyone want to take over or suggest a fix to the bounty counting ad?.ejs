<p>The app to count bounties might need to be resized to fit the new boundaries. Since <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2717/community-promotion-ads-2016/2719#2719">the answer was deleted by staff</a> - I wanted to put it here in case someone wants to step forward or re-implement this as their skill set and time allow. </p>

<ul>
<li>The current app runs on heroku at <a href="http://stack-exchange-dynamic-ads.herokuapp.com/apple.stackexchange.com/bounty.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://stack-exchange-dynamic-ads.herokuapp.com/apple.stackexchange.com/bounty.png</a></li>
