	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>I asked <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/113160/how-can-i-make-you-tube-full-screen-on-my-ipad-when-using-safari">this question</a> a while ago and it has garnered no upvotes and a single upvoted answer.  The answer is correct and useful so I accepted it.  </p>

<p>Today I happened back onto this question and see that it was "protected" to prevent answers by users with &lt; 10 rep.  My understanding of the use of "protection" is to prevent pile-on when questions go viral.</p>

<p>Why would such a low activity question get protected?</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>The question has attracted a bunch of "me too" answers which have been deleted (and which you can't see). The software behind AskDifferent automatically sets a topic to "protected" if the ratio between deleted and non-deleted questions gets too high.</p>

<p>I've unprotected it again for the moment, if it keeps attracting "me too" answers it will get procted again automatically.</p>
