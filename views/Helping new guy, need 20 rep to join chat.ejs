<p>Can we change the chat to be accessible for writing at +5 rep for AskDifferent? If it's based on a "permanent" number, could SE maybe update this so it's variable for each different site?</p>

<p>I think it's enough to have +5 on AskDifferent as we have awesome mods who will delete a user if he starts spamming our AskDifferent chatroom.</p>

				<p>I agree, that in some circumstances it's needlessly difficult for a new user to be able to contact and communicate with other users.  We have this weird situation where a user can create a chat account and log in, but only read, and I've seen conversations carried on where the OP talks in comments which he then deletes, and others reply in Chat, creating a disjointed approach that encourages the uses to use the bad habits (extended discussions in comments) that we try to avoid.</p>

<p>20 isn't a particularly difficult target to hit, but when it's your first question it seems massively complex to have to have these things explained when we don't have a way for them to participate in a 2 way chat.</p>

<p>Not sure how to fix it, I imagine that the points/privileges system is cast on stone for all SE sites, and we can't unilaterally change it for AD, but perhaps it could be considered for change site wide.</p>

<p>Here's an example of an user answering via comments:

				<p>Thanks to <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/users/237/mark">Mark</a> I don't even have to do the research any more :-)</p>

<p>There are valid reasons why a small amount of reputation is required for users to join chat (see the answers to <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/74086/so-chat-why-is-it-that-only-members-of-stack-overflow-with-at-least-20-reputat">SO Chat: Why is it that &quot;Only members of Stack Overflow with at least 20 reputation may talk...&quot;?</a> for instance). And as the mods can (with some collaboration from the user side) also invite users below 20 rep points to the main or any other chat, a feasible way to handle this (rather) rare case would be to flag such questions for moderator attention so one of us can push the user into chat.</p>
