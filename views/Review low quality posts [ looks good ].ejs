<p><strong>Review low quality posts</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes I see one of those one-line-answers and I write a comment below.
But after reviewing I have to click one of these options: <strong>Looks good</strong> - <strong>Edit</strong> - <strong>Improve</strong> - <strong>Skip</strong></p>

<p>What should I click after adding a comment?
Is that <strong>Looks good</strong> because I don't want the answer to be removed?
Or is it <strong>Skip</strong>?</p>

<p>Both doesn't look right to me, as I wrote a comment thus not skipping that review.</p>

				<p>I agree the naming of the options is confusing here. </p>

<p>The solution you want is Looks Good.</p>

<p>Basically Looks Good means I have reviewed the post and taken all the actions I can do. Skip always means I don't know what do to here - leave this in queue for another reviewer. </p>
