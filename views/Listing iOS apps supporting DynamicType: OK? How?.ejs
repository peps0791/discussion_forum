				<h2>Listing iOS apps supporting DynamicType: OK? How?</h2>
<p>I want to share a list of iOS apps that allow customizing font sizes:</p>

<ul>
<li>either through support of DynamicType / LargerText system settings</li>
<li>or have their own settings for font size</li>
</ul>

<p>(similar to <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/27897/making-fonts-larger-in-apps-under-lion/">"How to make text appear larger in various apps in OS X"</a>)</p>

<p>I would absolutely welcome others to contribute to the list.</p>

<hr>

<p>What is the best way to do that?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Add a table to <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/163399/54644">the original question</a> where it is very relevant (but not asked for directly), and adds much specifics to general statements like "some support, other don't; some are larger, others are the same"</p></li>
<li><p>Post a separate question, similar to "How to make text appear larger in various apps in OS X"--which is definitely better and easier for others to contribute and reuse</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Should I definitely mark the question (and/or my answer) as a "community wiki"; how do I decide?</p>

				<p>This seems helpful, but ultimately ill-suited for the site. Any list you make is going to go stale. Who will maintain it? You?</p>

				<p>@IanC. I don't expect too many contributors, and yes I'm ready to organize answers of half a dozen contributors (upper limit in my experience). Is that what you mean by "maintain"?</p>

				<p>Apps come and go. Someone needs to stay on top of the list to make sure stuff that's gone from the App Store is gone from the list. That's what I mean from maintain. It feels a bit like a magnet for advertising too. In general, I am not a fan "big lists of things" on this site. They don't work well with the SE format.</p>

			<div id = "comment-4355" class = "comment">
				<p>But it did work pretty well in "How to make text appear larger in various apps in OS X" linked above. How my proposal is different?</p>

				<p>@IanC. See above, forgot to mention you there.</p>

				<p>On that point, we appear to disagree. Because I don't think that worked "pretty well" at all. I don't think you could point me at a CW Q&A on this site that'd I think worked out well at all. But, I'm not authority here, and you should open the question up as a CW question like you proposed and let the community decide! :D</p>

				<p><p>So, to sum up my thoughts from the conversation above: post it. If it's good, the community will vote it up, if they disagree, they'll vote it down. I agree you should do it as CW, organized like that other CW Q&amp;A you linked to.</p>

				<p>Well, I have detailed data on 10-20 apps: support of Dynamic Type / Larger Text / app-specific font size settings, no font resizing at all. My options are: (1) just drop it => no one will ever use it; (2) attach it to the existing question where some people will be able to find it and use for their own reference, but hardly anyone will contribute; (3) create a separate question so that not only people can reuse it, but also have a chance to contribute. So yes, I'm going to go ahead and post it as a separate community wiki question / answer.</p>

				<p>Started listing the apps I tested [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/163576/which-of-ios-apps-allow-customizing-font-size/163579#163579). Still unsure whether to choose text listing or a preformatted table format--any feedback appreciated. Both options are shown there to easier compare the approaches.</p>

				<p><p>When I created <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/27897/making-fonts-larger-in-apps-under-lion/">Making fonts larger in apps under Lion</a>, it was partly to learn the answer and partly to try the sort of question that I hoped Community Wiki would work well for. I don't think it was a disaster, but it didn't turn out as great as I'd hoped it would. Maybe your question would take off in that format; if it can, I hope it does. I'd recommend trying, but I'm not overly hopeful it will get a great response. I'd recommend a separate question.</p>

				<p>Thanks. My primary purpose is to share my own findings, hoping they will be useful for others. Don't expect too many contributors, to be honest. Would welcome your opinion: [text listing or a preformatted table format?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/163579/54644) (examples of both are there to compare)</p>
