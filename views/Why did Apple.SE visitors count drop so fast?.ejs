				<h2>Why did Apple.SE visitors count drop so fast?</h2>
<p>Last month Apple.SE had 1k views/day on average but this week it has decreased to 500. Does anyone knows the reason?</p>

				<p><p>I suspect part of it is that it's currently the weekend - there is always a noticeable drop in views on Saturday and Sunday.</p>

<p>However the addition of all the gadgets questions has complicated matters:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>views_per_day there is the sum of all views (as determined by unique IP visits within a reasonable interval) on all questions (including deleted, closed, migrated, etc.) over <strong>the number of days the site has existed (as determined by the creation date of the oldest question)</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that we have much older questions on Apple.SE we have 50 or 60 days at present of very, very few views that previously did not exist at all.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/64863/how-is-views-day-calculated">How is views/day calculated?</a> on MSO as I believe they adjusted it over this past week.</p>

				<p>Nice catch  migrating questions from Gadgets definitely accounts for a big part of the drop. Oh well, some more [promoting](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/89/promoting-apple-se) needed :)</p>

				<p>Of note, the migration of the questions resulted in Apple.SE dropping from 1k to ~513. Whereas Android starts off at a paltry 79 views/day because of it.</p>

				<p>then what we can do to increase it again? must report to development team or something else?</p>

				<p>@Am1rr3zA Just get more visitors and eventually over time the "penalty" will lessen.</p>

				<p>The problem has been fixed! See the linked MSO question for details on how "views per day" is now calculated.</p>
