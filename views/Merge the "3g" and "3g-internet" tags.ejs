<p>Whilst I understand that the internet is a subset of 3G, questions tagged with <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/3g-internet" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;3g-internet&#39;" rel="tag">3g-internet</a> have either also been tagged with <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/3g" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;3g&#39;" rel="tag">3g</a> or refer to 3G in general.</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>Done - this was an easy merge / synonym to convert them all to <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cellular-data" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;cellular-data&#39;" rel="tag">cellular-data</a> with any further cleanup by retagging questions that were erroneously tagged as either 3g tag.</p>
