<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>Votes on comments are more similar to favs on Twitter/likes on FB in a way. The only functionality behind comment votes actually is that in case there are a lot of comments on a post, the ones with higher upvotes get displayed by default, not the chronologically oldest.</p>

<p>Question is slightly different than <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2429">What happens with deleted comments</a>, but the answers given there apply to comment "votes" as well. Comments aren't guarateed to persist, so voting on them doesn't impact your reputations etc. </p>


<p>tbh, I'd like a downvote option on comments too; for the truly idiotic, yet not actually offensive ones - to quickly push them out of contention. </p>

<p>Theoretical wild example:-<br>
OP wants to expand a drive partition.<br>
First comment is 'Wipe your drive, reinstall your OS'</p>

<p>It's not offensive; it's not 'strictly wrong', you <em>could</em> do it that way if you were so inclined; but it would be a whole lot more work than a smarter answer.</p>

<p>As an answer it would quickly get down voted, &amp; commented on itself, hopefully before the OP had chance to take up the idea.  </p>

<p>As a comment, there's no 'defence mechanism' for it.</p>
