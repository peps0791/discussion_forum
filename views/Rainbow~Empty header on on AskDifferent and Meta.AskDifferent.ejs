	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>For the last couple of weeks, I've had the weird rainbow header on AskDifferent, as seen in <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3033/why-do-i-occasionally-get-a-big-rainbow-in-the-top-banner">Why do I occasionally get a big rainbow in the top banner?</a></p>

<p>This is what it looks like:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uTAwQ.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/uTAwQ.png" alt="Rainbow Header"></a></p>

<p>The Meta site does not show a header at all, it's just blank:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/myKRP.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/myKRP.png" alt="Meta Site without header"></a></p>

<p>This is on Chrome 59.0.3071.115 on macOS 10.12.5. Other browsers (Safari) on the same machine work fine. Here's what I tried to fix this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Refresh the page with a hard reload/clear browser cache)</li>
<li>Logged out and in again - not easy since the log out/in links are not visible without the header</li>
<li>Tried to load the page on different networks (home/work)</li>
</ul>

<p>None of these have helped.</p>

<p>Other StackOverflow sites work fine. When loading the page, the header is visible for a second or two, then it's covered by the rainbow header or the empty header on Meta.</p>

<p>The issues is making AskDifferent pretty much unusable for me at the moment (at least from my default browser). Any idea what could be causing this?</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>Found the answer after a couple of minutes...</p>

<p>This issue was caused by the following TamperMonkey script: <a href="https://github.com/shu8/Stack-Overflow-Optional-Features" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/shu8/Stack-Overflow-Optional-Features</a></p>

<p>Disabling this in TamperMonkey made the site work again. The version in question is <em>1.8DEV</em>, which seems to be the latest version.</p>

<p>I've disabled this script now and everything is working again.</p>
