				<h2>Where did privileges go on the main site?</h2>
<p>I was looking to see what my next level of privileges was, but could not find the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/privileges">Privileges</a> page linked from anywhere (I had to resort to a Google search)</p>

<p>Have I missed it, or is it truly missing?</p>

				<p>If you hover the mouse pointer over your name, a menu pops up; one of the items on that menu is a link to the Privileges page. Not exactly intuitive, but yes, it's still present. Note that this only works on the <strong>Main</strong> site, not the <strong>Meta</strong> site. If you try it right after you read this answer, it won't work!</p>

<p>You'll note that the URL for you is as follows:</p>

<p><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/privileges/user/16529">https://apple.stackexchange.com/privileges/user/16529</a></p>

<p>You can plug in anyone's account number on the main site to see the privileges they are currently allowed due to reputation.</p>
