<p>Have I missed it, or is it truly missing?</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>If you hover the mouse pointer over your name, a menu pops up; one of the items on that menu is a link to the Privileges page. Not exactly intuitive, but yes, it's still present. Note that this only works on the <strong>Main</strong> site, not the <strong>Meta</strong> site. If you try it right after you read this answer, it won't work!</p>

<p>You'll note that the URL for you is as follows:</p>

<p><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/privileges/user/16529">https://apple.stackexchange.com/privileges/user/16529</a></p>

<p>You can plug in anyone's account number on the main site to see the privileges they are currently allowed due to reputation.</p>
