				<h2>Is this a potential community wiki question?</h2>
<p>Should <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/110575/is-possible-to-upgrade-ios-offline">this question</a> be made into a community wiki post, so we can just mark any "How do I go from iOS {x} to iOS {y}?" questions as a duplicate of this? Of course, we would need to rephrase the actual question be quite generic, but my answer on it has already been made as generic as possible. Perhaps it should just be a new question that I just ask and answer myself and mark as a wiki. Thoughts?</p>

				<p>I do not see why this sould be CW.</p>

<p>The question could be made a bit more general re the iOS versions but the answer seems to stay the same. Both seem good enough and covering an explict question so that they can be a normal answer</p>
