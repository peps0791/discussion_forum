<p>Specifically I'm asking for <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/120296/stuck-deactive-excelsheets-filter">this</a> question.
It appeared to me, that the Flagging > Closing > "another stackexchange page" option disappeared and the only redirection is now meta.apple.stackexchange.com.</p>

<p>Other Stackexchange sites(namely stackoverflow) still have this option.</p>

<li>Migration only works for new questions (<a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/151890/disable-migration-for-questions-older-than-60-days">past 60 days, migration is disabled on all SE sites</a>)</li>
<li><p>Each site can request limited sites for non-diamond moderators to choose for migration and this site in particular has only a couple listed. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/658/which-sites-should-be-in-our-primary-migration-paths">Which sites should be in our primary migration paths?</a></li>
