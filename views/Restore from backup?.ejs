  <p>I accidentally  </p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Wiped my boot drive  </li>
  <li>Tried to resize my partition  </li>
  <li>Tried to fix/adjust my Boot Camp partition from inside Windows  </li>
  <li>got a blank screen after a failed OS update  </li>
  <li>typed <code>sudo rm -rf /</code>  </li>
  <li>chown'd my entire machine  </li>
  <li>dropped my Mac/pad/phone &amp; now it doesn't work    </li>
  <li>lent my Mac/phone/pad to someone &amp; they...  </li>
  <li>disassembled my fusion drive</li>
  <li>Used beta software/APFS etc on a mission-critical machine</li>
  <li>Stored my only copy of valuable data on a flash drive</li>
  <li>etc etc etc</li>
  </ul>

<p>Then simply post the answer</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Restore your machine from your last backup</p>
</blockquote>

<p>mark it as correct &amp; link as a dupe every other question to which it applies.</p>

<p>So... my actual question is...<br>
<strong>Would this get me a hat?</strong></p>

<p><sup><em>Note: This entire question is not really meant to be taken seriously, but it's hat season, so why not.</em></sup></p>

<p><strong><em>Late Edit</em></strong><br>
Real-world examples, as I find them</p>

<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>Meta hat? Quite possibly. Would be diabolical to make you self Ask anD self answer on meta and on main for a pixel overlay. </p>

<p>I endorse the clear canonical question - especially if it helps get people a clear answer. </p>


<p>I disagree with creating a canonical question for this. With each one of those cases, whilst  restore from backup  is a suitable answer, there are other answers which apply to specific cases. For example, adjusting Boot Camp partition from Windows has many answers beside restoring from a backup, but those answers wouldn't apply to the other cases. Canonical answers are great, but make sure they only canonicalise those questions which are identical.</p>
