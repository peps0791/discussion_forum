		<p>I just re-calc'd your rep to verify that it was over 1K, and it is.</p>

<p>I get the impression that you're expecting to see something different on pages with votes, and that's not actually the case. If you take a look at the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/privileges/view-vote-counts">privilege page</a>, you see this figure:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3iJAd.png" alt="show vote figure"></p>

<p>When the page loads, you see the picture on the left. If you click on the vote count, it will <em>then</em> display the breakdown.</p>
