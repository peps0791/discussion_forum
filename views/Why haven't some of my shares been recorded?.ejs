				<h2>Why haven't some of my shares been recorded?</h2>
<p>I had everything I needed to qualify for Level 2 in the contest - the 20 required questions with 2 upvotes each, the votes, and even the sharing.</p>

<p>I posted a picture on my website with the text "Ask and answer questions about Macs! Click to see more!", which my users quickly ate up. They click on <em>anything</em>.</p>

<p>The links were tracked with a URL shortener, which let me see exactly how many clicks I had. After a short amount of time, my quota was filled (I looked at the URL shortener's stats and I saw for each of the 11 {just to be safe} ads, at least 15 clicks on each one). One of my users even signed up and made an account.</p>

<p>Thus, I was feeling pretty confident that my place was secured. Knowing that the site had probably some lag, I wasn't surprised when the share progress bar told me I had 7 - it was 5 a few minutes ago. I knew, thanks to the shortened URLs, that I was in the 'way past safe' category.</p>

<p>This all made it a complete surprise to me that I didn't get into Level Two. See <a href="http://thenewipadishere.com/" rel="nofollow">http://thenewipadishere.com/</a>; as of now, I'm still not listed.</p>

<p>Is it possible for a moderator or someone at Stack Exchange to take a look at the links I posted and investigate whether they should have been counted towards the contest?</p>

				<p>Which link style did you use:</p>

<p><code>http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/q/1254/219</code></p>

<p>or</p>

<p><code>http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1254/what-happened-with-the-link-sharing</code></p>

<p>The second type doesn't count, it has to have your user number at the end of the link as with the first style.</p>

<p>If you want to make the contest administrator's jobs easier, provide a list of the URLs you advertised that you believe were clicked at least 5 times.  I imagine this information is still in your URL tracking service.</p>

			</div><br>
			<div id = "post-ans" class = "post">
				<p>Some things to note:</p>

<ul>
<li>As mentioned, links must be in the correct format (ending with your
user ID, 6730).</li>
<li>You must have 10 unique links. Posting a link to the same post
multiple times can only count towards one share.</li>
<li>To count as a share, each link (or all links to a specific post
combined) must be clicked by at least 5 unique IP addresses. Even if the URL shortener reports that a link has been clicked many times, it's possible that it has been clicked multiple times by the same person.</li>
<li>I'm not 100% sure, but it's my guess, that links to closed or deleted
questions aren't counted.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, the link tracking systems here are pretty reliable. They're not a new feature and are used for things other than contests.<br>
Realistically, it is more likely that the URL shortener is reporting a different metric than Stack Exchange is recording (or misreporting altogether) than it is that Stack Exchange's tracking isn't working.</p>

<p>Moderators have no more access to link information or influence on contest results than you do; Stack Exchange will have to be the ones to investigate further.</p>

<p>Sorry that things aren't working out as expected!</p>

</ul>

<p>To be sure that there's nothing wrong here, I looked at the server access logs, which record <em>all</em> requests to your shared URLs, not just those that eventually counted as a valid referral.</p>

<p>In looking at the logs, I made these two observations about a vast (!) majority of the requests:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They came in bunches. The requests didn't come naturally in a "hey, this looks interesting, I'll check it out" pattern; instead they look like a "here's a bunch of links, all of which I shall now click within quick succession, maybe even twice for good measure."</p></li>
<li><p>They either came very obviously from you, or the reqesting IP address belonged to one of these groups:</p>

<ul>
<li>registered to an institution that you seem to have ties to,</li>
<li>registered to dedicated hosting providers,</li>
<li>well-known proxy.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>I am therefore inclined to consider the assumption that you didn't meet the sharing requirements to be correct.</p>
