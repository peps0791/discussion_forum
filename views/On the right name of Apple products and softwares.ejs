				<h2>On the right name of Apple products and softwares</h2>
<p>May this is too early and maybe I'm the only one concern, but at a certain point shouldn't we correct the name of Apple products and softwares to match their real name ?</p>

<p>For examples : </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>iTunes</strong> instead of Itunes</li>
<li><strong>iPhone</strong> instead of Iphone</li>
<li><strong>Mac OS X</strong> instead of Mac OSX</li>
<li>and so on  </li>
</ul>

				<p><p>Yes. Particularly in the case of tags, it seems important to get this right for cases like "OS X", where it affects the accuracy of searches. </p>

				<p><p>Correcting in posts would be fine, though no one has edit powers yet so that's a moot point.</p>

				<p><p>Would it be allowed to mis-spell certain words to make a point? (I'm not talking about tags, were you absolutely need one authoritative spelling.) Should I be able to write about <em>iDontWork</em> when I'm complaining about <em>iWork</em>? What about <em>Micro$oft</em>?</p>

<p>We have a similar (but more narrow) discussion on the WordPress site, where (for the moment) one user (sometimes) prefers to write <em>Wordpress</em> instead of <em>WordPress</em>. Since this is the subject of our site, opinions are divided on <a href="https://wordpress.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/96/should-we-ask-for-reasonable-consistency-in-style-for-things-like-wordpress-vs">whether we should allow this</a>, or <a href="https://wordpress.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/112/proposal-why-wordpress-or-wordpress-and-not-wordpress-campaign/138#138">provide a way to signal the "protest"</a> so others won't edit it away.</p>

				<p>Tags like `[idontwork]` or `[micro$oft]` will be fixed by editing - they don't help people find the question and Micro$oft is rather petty.</p>

				<p>@Chealion: Maybe I was not clear enough, but I was talking about post content, not tags. And indeed these things are petty, but edit wars are generally not about the important things...</p>

			<div id = "comment-154" class = "comment">
				<p>Sorry, I get it now. I'd say no - it detracts from the question. On Super User I've edited questions that had these and never had an issue. There are other ways of making a point without annoying anyone who might actually answer your question.</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-157" class = "comment">
				<p>Same opinion as Chealion, we shouldn't allow these terms.</p>
