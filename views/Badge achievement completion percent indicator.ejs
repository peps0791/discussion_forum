				<h2>Badge achievement completion percent indicator</h2>
<p>There are some badges which requires a certain number of "Actions". For example</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Commentator: Left 10 comments</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Announcer: shared a link to a question that was visited by 25 unique IP addresses </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there a way for check how far a person is from obtaining the badge?
Maybe it's easy to count the comments. It is also possible to control how many review I have completed. But I wouldn't be able of checking how many unique IP have visited a question I shared.</p>

<p>If this feature is not present, wouldn't it be useful?</p>

				<p><p>I don't think that there is a progress marking for the easier to achieve badges. You can see things on the review tab where the longer to achieve tasks do get progress bars.</p>

<p>So in general, the developers of the site are aware that showing progress is good, however it's hard to know which items they may add features to. By asking here or the <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/">main meta</a> and making a case for a specific progress bar, you might move the people paying the salaries of the developers to add that item to their work queue.</p>

<p>I personally don't see a burning need to address something as small as the announcer badge. If you work on asking a good question, the views will come. Also the sharing tools for social media will help if you have a question that's close to getting the views needed for that badge.</p>

				<p>I knew about the possibility of seeing how many reviews I completed. My question was not about increasing the number of views. It was more a curiosity about the badge progress. Thanks!!</p>

				<p>Perfect - hopefully it's clear that there isn't a dashboard for all badge progress that any of us can see.</p>
