<p>In my opinion, to have the Q&amp;A stand as it is not an improvement over the previous version, especially by removing the comment that points out the technical inaccuracy of the accepted answer.

				<p>Comments are ephemeral. Especially if they turn into a long exchange, we delete them. Notice the warning telling you to avoid extended discussions in comments. Either edit the answer if the answer's poster is on board, or propose a new answer.</p>
