	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>So we've <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1030/should-we-have-posts-on-meta-that-arent-questions-that-can-be-answered">established</a> that it's appropriate for meta to contain questions that aren't really answerable. Which suggests that the algorithm whereby Community  randomly bumps questions without accepted answers to the top of the list might not be a particularly good idea in meta.</p>

<p>Case in point: podcast #2 was just bumped to the top of meta. Really?
