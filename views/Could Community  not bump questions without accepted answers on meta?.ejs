				<h2>Could Community  not bump questions without accepted answers on meta?</h2>
<p>So we've <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1030/should-we-have-posts-on-meta-that-arent-questions-that-can-be-answered">established</a> that it's appropriate for meta to contain questions that aren't really answerable. Which suggests that the algorithm whereby Community  randomly bumps questions without accepted answers to the top of the list might not be a particularly good idea in meta.</p>

<p>Case in point: podcast #2 was just bumped to the top of meta. Really?

				<p>Feature request, IMO. [Community  ](http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/-1/) is doing it's intended behavior, behavior I don't think it should have on any meta site. (At least not by default. If someone thinks it should be on a meta, that should be their exception, not the rule.)</p>

				<p>Where is the list of what and how http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/-1/ (aka [Community  ](http://apple.stackexchange.com/users/-1/)) does it's tasks? Sometimes I'd ask it to just go calculate the square root of it's user number and come back when it has an answer.</p>

				<p>It just has to use its imagination, @bmike, and the answer's easy.</p>

				<p>Someone downvoted this -- if you just think this isn't a priority, great, but if you have an argument why it's actually desirable to randomly bump unanswered posts on meta, please do respond; I'd love to hear the argument.</p>
