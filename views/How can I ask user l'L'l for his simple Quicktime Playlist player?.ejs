		<p>If you earn more reputation you can participate in the chat forums. If you earn even more reputation, you can write comments on others' posts.</p>


<p>However in general you can't contact an individual user. This is by design in Stack Exchange see <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/431/any-way-to-send-a-personal-message-to-another-user">this meta stackexchange question</a></p>


<p>You should put your contact information in your profile (the info I edited out of your question body). Similarly, if someone wants to be contacted outside the site, you can look in their profile.</p>

<p>If you link to the user in question, I'll explain where that contact info lies. For me, look at <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/5472/bmike">https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/5472/bmike</a></p>

<p>The site notification methods are to @user ping them in comments or chat. Both of these require you to gain some reputation so asking here is your only hope of pinging the user without them self-disclosing their contact information or you gaining reputation.</p>
