<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>The down vote process asks people to consider leaving constructive criticism, but it isn't required. Sometimes there's nothing significant about a vote other than someone, somehwere on the internet didn't like the post. </p>

<p>or a cat is operating someone's browser and can't figure out how to take the down vote back:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lxx2G.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lxx2G.jpg" alt="oh noes, what has I done?"></a></p>

<p>Other times, there's an obvious link to:</p>

<p>A) not enough research shown<br>
B) not enough specificity<br>
C) several questions being asked<br>
D) just not a useful question in one person's eyes</p>

<p>I don't think your answer is nearly as bad as the question. Maybe people felt virus total is spammy?</p>
