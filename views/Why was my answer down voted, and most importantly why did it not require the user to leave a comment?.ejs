				<h2>Why was my answer down voted, and most importantly why did it not require the user to leave a comment?</h2>
<p>I am new here and am a little confused. Why are you allowed to down vote an answer without leaving a comment? That provides me with no information as to how to improve my answer. </p>

<p><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/266556/is-this-safe-place-to-download/266559#266559">Is this safe to download and use Gutenprint driver for Mac from their site?</a></p>

<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

				<p>I didn't and wouldn't downvote your answer, but I could see someone objecting because it makes a rather blanket statement. Basically, you wrote, 'if you want to know if it's safe, ask VirusTotal'; this implies that VirusTotal is 100% accurate, which we know to be impossible in practice. I might have worded it a little differently, such as "if they say it's safe, it's probably safe"</p>

				<p><p>The down vote process asks people to consider leaving constructive criticism, but it isn't required. Sometimes there's nothing significant about a vote other than someone, somehwere on the internet didn't like the post. </p>

<p>or a cat is operating someone's browser and can't figure out how to take the down vote back:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lxx2G.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lxx2G.jpg" alt="oh noes, what has I done?"></a></p>

<p>Other times, there's an obvious link to:</p>

<p>A) not enough research shown<br>
B) not enough specificity<br>
C) several questions being asked<br>
D) just not a useful question in one person's eyes</p>

<p>I don't think your answer is nearly as bad as the question. Maybe people felt virus total is spammy?</p>
