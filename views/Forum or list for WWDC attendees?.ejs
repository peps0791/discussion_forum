	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>I guess I haven't found the right search terms to find this on my own, so I figured I ask. </p>

<p>Is there a forum or something out there where people who are going to WWDC trade information? Stuff like trip advice, informal birds-of-a-feather sessions, parties, etc. Or does all that kind of coordination happen over Twitter these days?</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>I'd be happy to open a chat room for people to discuss WWDC and share links and stories. If it gets too crowded, we can make others. Would that suit your desires to have a conversation and share WWDC plans?</p>


<p>All WWDC attendees should have access to Apple's Developer Forums.  Some discussion seems to take place there.</p>
