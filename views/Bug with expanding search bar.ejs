	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>After performing a search in the search bar the search terms remain in the bar.  If you click in the bar to change the search terms, the first character you type is inserted where you clicked but the cursor then moves to the end of the line and anything you type goes here instead.  </p>

<p>Firefox 3.6.18 on Windows XP Pro SP3</p>

<p>Instructions to reproduce:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Type search term 'break key'  </li>
<li>Hit Enter  </li>
<li>Page of results loads with 'break key' still in search box  </li>
<li>Click mouse in front of the 'b' in 'break' and start to type 'macbook'  </li>
<li>'m' appears in front of 'break key' making 'mbreak key' and then the search box expands  </li>
<li>cursor moves to the end of the search string 'mbreak key' resulting in 'mbreak keyacbook'</li>
</ul>
