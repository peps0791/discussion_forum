<p>Not that it matters, but I was just wondering...</p>

<p>I just got +3 reputation for an upvote. But I always thought an upvote is +10, no?</p>

				<p>Very strange! I thought I had an answer for you, but the more I look at it, the less I can explain this.</p>

				<p>What did you had in mind? I did however offered a bounty of 50 reputation today... Maybe I reached my limit?</p>

				<p>Hm, odd. Try looking at http://apple.stackexchange.com/reputation to get a second opinion.</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-2153" class = "post">
				<p>Yes, then that would likely be the problem. There is a 200 reputation cap. If you offered the bounty after the +3, subsequent votes could still give you reputation, but the +10 would have passed the maximum.</p>

				<h3>Score ::4</h3>
				<p><p>In general, up votes on <strong>answers</strong> are worth +10 and up votes on <strong>questions</strong> are worth +5. There are exceptions. There is a daily reputation cap of 200, and if you hit it at the time you were upvoted, you would only receive the score that brings your total up to 200.</p>

				<p>Thanks for the info, but take a look at my updated message... If I can count correctly, I count 219 reputation - 50 bounty = 169, right?</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-2155" class = "post">
				<p>Right, but you don't have your results displayed chronologically. The cap applies at the time you hit it. If you got an upvote that would have brought you above 200 **before** you offered the bounty, your score would still be limited.</p>

				<p>Ok, thanks for your answer :)</p>
