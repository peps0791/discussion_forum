				<h2>Should I delete my question or keep it?</h2>
<p>Not finding a solution, I posted <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/243092/19937">this question</a> but now see it is covered by <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/179150/19937">this one with an answer</a>.</p>

<p>Should I just delete it, or is it better to close as a duplicate?</p>

				<p><p>Thanks for bringing this up on meta so quickly. As already remarked by <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/85275/tetsujin">@Tetsujin</a> in the comments:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We can keep it &amp; link it as a duplicate - which gives Google a greater chance of finding the answer in future. I'll vote to close as a dupe; it doesn't reflect on the quality of the question, merely links it to an existing one with a highly-voted answer.</p>
