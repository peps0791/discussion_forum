				<h2>How do you get to the page that describes reputation privileges you have earned?</h2>
<p>The other day when I logged in I received a notification.  It said that I was now able to vote to close questions.  I have already had this privilege for awhile, but I clicked on the details link in the notification and it took me to a page that describes all the different privileges I have earned or have yet to earn along with their associated reputation requirements.</p>

<p>I have no idea how one would access this page from anywhere on the site itself.  I've looked through my user pages and such but can't find anything.  Is there a link somewhere that I'm missing?</p>

				<p><p>I don't know if this is a new addition, but you can click on your reputation score at the top of the site and it brings you to the privileges page.</p>

				<p><p>Clicking your reputation is no longer sufficient with the advent of the new top bar.</p>

<p>Go to your user page, either by clicking yourself in the top bar or through any other means, then click the privileges link next to the profile edit link.</p>
