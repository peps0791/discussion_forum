				<h2>Is the pale blue of texts   on white, pale blue and beige backgrounds   too pale at Ask Different?</h2>
<h1>Is the pale blue <em>too</em> pale?</h1>

<p>I think so, but alternative answers will be appreciated. </p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I'm usually a careful reader, but at least twice I have missed things of importance, because of the paleness of the pale blue text that is currently used at Ask Different. </p>

<p><strong>Lack of contrast</strong> can cause some words, or words in some contexts, to be too easily overlooked. Loosely we might describe this as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_blindness" rel="nofollow noreferrer">word blindness</a> but the contrast/faintness issue could affect anyone, not just dyslexics. </p>

<h2>Considerations</h2>

<hr>

<p>There may be comparable questions/answers in other meta areas, and I don't know whether the pale blue that's currently used is based on a template from a different stack, but I thought I should focus first on the Ask Different area. </p>

				<p>@Nathan hi, at http://www.wuala.com/%23%23Apple-support/members/grahamperrin/2011/08/03/a/?mode=gallery folders a and b, each containing three versions of one screenshot. The second of each triplet shows where I get the word blindness. In (a) I was blind to an entire line that I had written  a real "hmm" moment. Example (b) might be more understandable  very short username pale on pale, surrounded by things that are larger and darker. A little blur (not just for dramatic effect) and hopefully you'll see what I mean.</p>

				<p>The red/green was a clear temporary error. The designers didn't intend / realize how far that change would go and reverted it until other changes could roll out at the same time.</p>

				<p>Again today I looked at a page a few times but could not see what I wanted. This time it was pale blue on beige that wasn't 'sinking in'. Maybe it's just me but it's really unusual for me to be missing things so often   http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/1543321#1543321</p>

				<p><p>I would love to see a much stronger blue to have more contrast for all the blue text.</p>

<p>Even if the designers felt it was the wrong choice, i'd love to see a week or two to try it out - let everyone know we're trying it (or don't). Then revert it for two weeks to "study the results".</p>

<p>You will have hard data on how many complaints were lodged due to the initial change - and due to the reversion back (from those that liked the new).</p>

<p>I would propose something like the new </p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/7ziMU.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Especially the darker shades when examined in a loupe on LCD panels.

<p>I should also inquire as the beer preference of the designers and the address to which it should be sent for critiquing their work since it is never easy to re-design something since the colors we have now is the color they came up with, and not by accident.</p>

				<p><p>I don't have any problem with legibility, but as a new user I'm stumped when it comes to the significance of the blue and beige backgrounds. I expected the FAQ to provide an explanation, but this wasn't the case. Can anyone enlighten me?</p>

				<p>Compared with for example http://i.stack.imgur.com/hUCvY.png (taken from http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/q/268/8546) I guess that the **beige** of each question and answer, with grey between each one, helps to distinguish each post. I see blue backgrounds used in various ways, most recently in [a popular question](http://apple.stackexchange.com/q/17759/8546). Also, Ask Different *meta* is more brown and beige than Ask Different. If that doesn't answer your question, maybe it needs to be asked as a question ;-)</p>

				<p>Thanks for that. I'll take you up on that concluding gentle hint and ask a question (though now it seems that beige backgrounds have been retired?).</p>
