				<h2>Question was locked and put on hold, but the banners only show 'on hold' and migration</h2>
<p>Came across this question:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/114081/enforcing-single-document-copy-in-ios">Enforcing single docent copy in iOS [on hold]</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It's on hold and locked, according to timeline, and I can't comment/edit </p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QXbdi.png" height="60"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QPKwg.png" height="30"></p>

<p>Yet the banners below the post only shows the migration and the 'on hold' state, with no mention of the lock:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yrrJk.png"></p>

<p>Is this <a href="/questions/tagged/status-bydesign" class="post-tag moderator-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;status-bydesign&#39;" rel="tag">status-bydesign</a>? I've tagged this as <a href="/questions/tagged/support" class="post-tag required-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;support&#39;" rel="tag">support</a> instead of <a href="/questions/tagged/bug" class="post-tag required-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;bug&#39;" rel="tag">bug</a> because I'm not sure yet.</p>

<p><em>If so, there seems to be a further problem, since the 'on hold' banner says 'please edit the question' which can't happen because it's locked </em></p>

				<p>Does that mean that this is a bug? What exactly happened here   should there have been a 'locked' banner as well as the 'on hold' banner?</p>

				<p>It's not clear if the lock came from the sending site or was a glitch. We get so few migrations into the site, that it's a rare occurrence when a moderator closes a question soon after migration and then community locks the post.</p>

				<p>I know I didn't intend for it to be locked; just put on hold. But given that the OP doesn't have an account here, I'm not hopeful that it will be edited into something useful.</p>

				<p>Just noticed this question on Meta.SO: http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/147766/what-is-the-reason-for-locking-a-question-migrated-from-another-site-that-is-the Seems the answer is an answer to this too </p>
