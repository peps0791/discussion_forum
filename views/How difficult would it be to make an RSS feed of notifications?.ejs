<p>I'm picturing an RSS feed for each user which would contain notifications from the Inbox. This way, I could get an instant notification via Boxcar or ifttt and wouldn't find out three hours later.</p>

<p>An alternative would be to send the emails immediately, but only if the user is not currently on the site.</p>
