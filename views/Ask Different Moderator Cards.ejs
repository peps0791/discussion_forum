	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>We recently printed some business cards for our Stack Exchange employees and they turned out great.</p>

<p>It got us thinking: our sites' moderators have been working hard to keep our sites high quality for the past few years. They may not be employees, per se, but great community moderators are why our communities are safe, sane, and worth visiting in the first place </p>

<p>If you're a moderator on the main site, would you be interested in having your own Ask Different contact card? Would you find it useful?</p>

<p>I can see them being handy to pass out during your local meetups or conferences.</p>

<p>Below is a mockup:</p>

<p>Of course Twitter ID/phone# are optional. It can be Skype, AIM, URL etc.</p>

<p><sub>Note: the text rendering in the mockup is slightly blurry. But when printed it will be crisp.</sub></p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>OK, moderators have officially been mailed the form to obtain the cards. Stay tuned!</p>
