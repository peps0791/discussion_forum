	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>I wrote a brief answer to <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/54064/permission-denied-error-when-copying-to-usr-local-bin">this question</a>, and almost immediately got a message attached to the answer, saying</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We're looking for long answers that provide some explanation and
  context. Don't just give a one-line answer: please explain <em>why</em> you're
  recommending it as a solution. Answers that don't explain anything
  will be deleted. See <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/">Good Subjective, Bad Subjective</a> for more
  information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn't have the time right then to write a paragraph explaining what <code>sudo</code> does, so rather than have a moderator delete my answer, I deleted it myself. Some twenty minutes later, another equally short and non-explanatory answer appeared and was accepted.</p>

<p>This episode is no big deal to me   it only took me moments to write my answer, and if someone else gets a few points of reputation for answering the question, I couldn't care less. But I am puzzled and curious: The message seems like a canned message. Does the software post such messages automatically, or does some moderator push a button to make it happen? Also, I don't see the relevance of the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/good-subjective-bad-subjective/">Good Subjective, Bad Subjective</a> article to a criticism concerning either shortness or lack of explanations. Whatever might be wrong with my answer, <em>subjective</em> is not it!</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>Your answer was flagged as being "low quality". In responding to the flag as a moderator, I disagreed that it was low quality (it was correct and on-target), but it did have plenty of room for improvement, so I responded to the flag by attaching the post notification inviting more explanation. The flag was automated. My response was human, but it was from a rather limited set of menu choices. While "subjective" is indeed not the issue at hand, the article linked does have some suggestions about how to improve upon short posts.</p>

<p>In the future, you don't need to think of that as an invitation to delete your post. If you or someone else come back and expand your answer, that is a wonderful thing. If no one does over the course of a few months, we will try to come back and either delete or improve such posts, but there really is a window here, and while you are welcome to improve the post yourself, it isn't all up to you. If you start a good answer, someone else can extend it. If you delete it, it is no longer there for the community to build on.</p>

<p>The language of the standard notification is perhaps more threatening than I'd like it to be, but we moderators can't change it; it's standardized system-wide.</p>

<p>I thought your answer was a great start; I attached the post notification to encourage either you or someone else to improve on it by explaining more.</p>

<p>I'm sorry this situation worked out the way it did. I was trying to send the message "good start, but we'd love to see more here."</p>


<p>I would like to make an official post to support brevity in answers. There is nothing wrong with a short answer if it helps the user. In fact, I think concise answers should be preferred. Unnecessarily long answers waste a user's time.</p>

<p>This is standard practice on Stack Overflow, where the most highly voted answers are almost always concise:</p>
