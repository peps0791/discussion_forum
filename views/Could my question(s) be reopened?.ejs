				<h2>Could my question(s) be reopened?</h2>
<p>I made a small goof.</p>

<p>I asked two hardware questions about Keyboards and Mice.  The questions are very similar and, accidentally, I typed in the same title for both (referencing keyboards.)</p>

<p>These questions managed to get put on hold and flagged as duplicates.  I've updated the questions and fixed my errors.  Could I have them re-opened?</p>

				<p><p>These questions will, unfortunately, remain closed, for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Both are shopping questions and <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic">shopping questions are off topic for Ask Different</a>. You're asking for a purchase recommendation in both questions. Shopping or buying recommendations. Questions that are mainly about price/time/supply constraints are considered "shopping" questions.</li>
<li>Both are asking for "best" options. While you do give some criteria for filtering purchase options, "best" is ultimately <em>very</em> subjective in these cases and as such there's no, real, canonical answer that can be given and that's not what Stack Exchange is about when it comes to Q&amp;A.</li>
</ol>

<p>Ultimately these questions are better suited for a traditional discussion forum format. You can find something akin to this in <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/38/ask-different-chat">our chat room</a> or take advantage of an existing forum like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.reddit.com/r/apple</a>.</p>

				<p>My definition of "best" isn't subjective, really.  I think the implicationnis clear, is there hardware that functiona best in both environments.  I'll remove the parts about pricing when I get a chance.</p>

			<div id = "comment-6157" class = "comment">
				<p>A standard keyboard works *best* in both environments, as does a plain vanilla mouse :-) Or in other words: without a clear indication about what "best" means for you and how you want to measure it, "best" always is subjective.</p>
