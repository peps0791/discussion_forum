				<h2>What is the average helpful~declined flag rate?</h2>
<p>Having just surpassed 500 helpful flags (and got a wonderful gold badge!) I'm wondering how my accuracy in flagging is compared to the average user.</p>

				<p>Short Answer: You can't.</p>

<p>Long Answer: I'm afraid you can't ;)</p>

<p>Flags is like votes, you can see your own, we can't.  You have access to the raw data, and can compile stats from it, but there's no handy page, not even for a Mod, that will do it.</p>
