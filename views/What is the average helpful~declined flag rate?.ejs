<p>In case numbers can't be disclosed, here is my current flagging history to allow for comments such as 'high'/'low':</p>

<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>Short Answer: You can't.</p>

<p>Long Answer: I'm afraid you can't ;)</p>

<p>Flags is like votes, you can see your own, we can't.  You have access to the raw data, and can compile stats from it, but there's no handy page, not even for a Mod, that will do it.</p>
