				<h2>Who should the moderators be?</h2>
<h2><a href="https://webmasters.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/153/moderator-nominations">Guidelines</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Use this thread. Each nomination should be a separate answer. Link the name to the user's profile so we can see their activity.</li>
<li>The nominee should indicate their acceptance by commenting on (or indeed editing) the answer.</li>
<li>Vote on users you feel will make <strong><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/">good Moderator candidates</a></strong>. <strong>Please be civil and respectful.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We are looking for members who are deeply engaged in the community development; members who:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are currently a registered user in good standing.</li>
<li>Have a reasonably high reputation score to indicate active, consistent participation.</li>
<li>Exhibit patience and fairness at all times in their questions, answers, and comments.</li>
<li>Lead by example, showing respect for their fellow community members in everything they write.</li>
<li>Want the responsibility. Moderators volunteer a lot of time and work. Its can be hugely rewarding experience but it isn't always a popularity contest.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bonus points for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Being the site proposer or heavily involved in the proposal process.</li>
<li>Members who referred a lot of followers/committees on Area 51.</li>
<li>Members with participation in <em>both</em> meta and the parent site (i.e. interest in both community building and expertise in the field).</li>
</ul>

<p>These users will be contacted and three of them will be selected to act as Moderators until the formal elections.</p>

<p>They will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have access to the tools to perform the duties of Moderation</li>
<li>Have access to a special chat room where they will collectively work through the challenges of moderation and community self-policing with the Stack Exchange team</li>
<li>Drive the process of selecting the site's attributes (domain names, design issues, the FAQ, etc.)</li>
<li>Help get publicity for their sites and organize their communities</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, <strong>they will have the ear of the Stack Exchange team for anything they can do to help this site succeed.</strong> They will act as a liaison&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;a job that "links" Stack Overflow with this community.</p>

<p>Moderators solve a basic scalability problem. The SE team can't be in each site, identifying the issues and helping each community grow. That's where Moderators come in; they make sure communities are enabled to solve these problems where they can and elicit help when necessary.</p>

				<p>@calavera: If the gaming SE site is any indication, the SE staff will select someone (or some people) they think is appropriate from the nominations as "temporary" mods. Eventually, public elections will be held, and those (I believe) will be done as they are on the Stack Overflow sites: With actual voting, separate from the Q&A system.</p>

				<p>I just submitted some heavy edits, mostly from [another excellent post](http://meta.gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/211/moderator-nominations). I still feel it is far too early to ask, however since it has been asked we might as well make it complete.</p>

				<p>@calavera: I don't see why you explicitly removed the invitation to self-nominate that every other system had. What's wrong with someone offering to help the community? Then everyone votes. Now you don't have nearly enough candidates to consider. Oh, well. I'll do my best to find suitable candidates.</p>

				<p>@Robert Cartaino: see the answer below where we were discussing self-nomination.  If you think it should be added back in, go for it, it's community wiki after all.  Probably should start a new topic though and get a consensus since now we have conflicting opinions.</p>

				<p><p>I know he's not even here yet, but Kyle Cronin might be a good candidate.  He was the original site proposer, and has been active on other sites, including SuperUser, specifically in the Mac space:

				<p>And I *think* he's only a mod on Meta.SO right now, so it's not like we're adding to someone who's overworked.</p>

				<p>I'd love to do it. I do apologize for my absence on the site - I've had DSL problems at home and have been unable to visit during work, and I'm going to be away for the next few days as well, but I hope to make up for the lost time after that.</p>

				<p><p>I did it on gaming, I'll do it here too: I'm putting my hat in the ring. I'd be happy to help, but also just fine deferring to whomever the community nominates.</p>

				<p>I agreed with Josh K, but doesn't the third line of your post said "Self nominations are okay." ?</p>

				<p>@Studer: It's not mine, it's someone elses that I simply moved in here because I felt it was the best there was. I feel differently, though didn't want to edit the original simply because my views are different. I let my votes display my views.</p>

			<div id = "comment-101" class = "comment">
				<p>Josh, maybe you should put a comment on the OP then, rather than downvoting John's self-nomination.  Poor guy was just following instructions :)</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-102" class = "comment">
				<p>FWIW I agree, nominations should ideally come from others.  But self-nomination is no big deal I think, since you can see that it tends to have the opposite effect :)</p>

				<p><p>I nominate Chealion.  He/she (doesn't specify in their user profile, but I'll use he from here on out based on an educated statistical guess :) ) seems to be pretty open-minded, active, and easy-going.  He provides good answers, and doesn't seem to spam for points (most of his answers have been upvoted multiple times or accepted outright).  </p>

<p>He also makes good comments, and provides lots of votes, which I think is a good sign of someone who would make a great moderator.</p>
