	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>I have read about the community user. It is a bot that pulls old questions out, does site chores, owns unregistered users questions, protects when questions attract "me too!" answers.</p>

<p>But the profile page doesn't mention anything about approving and rejecting edits. How does that work? Does a bot do that, or is it a person? How does it know if it is a good edit or not?</p>

<p><a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1611/community-accepted-crappy-suggested-edit">Here</a> is a similar question, though the answer is not really what I wanted. </p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>The Community User always is a bot. See <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/19738/who-is-the-community-user">this post on Meta SE</a> for some more details.</p>

<p>Also, the profile page for that user is quite descriptive:</p>

<p><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/-1/community?tab=profile">https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/-1/community?tab=profile</a></p>

<p>If you find something that isn't documented there, we can open a new question to have that addressed.</p>

<p>As for <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/109411">this edit</a>, the user approving it has >2000 reputation, so he can approve edits directly (see apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/edit). The community user in this case merely takes note of this fact and removes the edit from the queue (which is logged/registered as another approving edit).</p>
