				<h2>Why was the gadgets site merged into this one?</h2>
<p>I have a feeling this will be somewhat controversial, but to be perfectly frank it seems like the Apple.SE site and the community that was forming around it was quite OS X centered.  Now with the huge influx of iOS related questions, the site seems disjointed and less focused. </p>

<p>Personal opinion: A lot of OS X users don't have much interest in iphone or ipod, and generally ignore these questions, but it's hard when so many are suddenly about these devices.</p>

<p>Why did the sites need to be merged in the first place? </p>

				<p>+1 for wondering about merging OSX and iOS! I have an iPhone but no Mac. In my view, the iOS questions kind of drown in the OSX "noise" here. `OSX != iOS` !</p>

				<p><p>I believe there wasn t much activity going on on Gadgets anyway and most were iPhones/iPods/iPads.</p>

				<p>A lot (most?) of the questions were about Apple gear and Android gear. (Obviously, only *Apple questions* were merged here.) Reasons why they decided to close it are [detailed in the blog](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/pruning-season/).</p>

				<p><p>I think it was a pretty logical thing to do to migrate iPhone, iPad, and other Apple gadget questions here after the Gadgets site was <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/pruning-season/">closed</a>. Why? <strong>This is the only SE site where they are on-topic</strong>.</p>

<p>If we go back and look at the <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/151?phase=definition">Apple site proposal</a> at Area 51, there is nothing there that defines this site as "OS X only" or "OS X mostly" (although it <em>is</em> true that the top on-topic examples are Mac/OS X ones). (Also, if Apple SE actually was "Mac / OS X only", that would mean there was no need for it in the first place, as Mac and OS X are perfectly on-topic at <a href="https://superuser.com/">Super User</a>.)</p>

<p>If you consider <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>, is it becoming "disjointed" with the huge influx of questions on Ruby or Python that the average C# programmer really doesn't have much interest in? By the way, <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/merging-season/">Spolsky discusses</a> the SE scope issue in the latest blog entry; interesting read.</p>

<p>Bottom line: if you don't care much about iOS related questions, you can easily ignore them. (You can tweak your prefs so that you don't even <em>see</em> those questions, if you want to.) I don't think merging in those questions does harm to the community, at least in the long run.</p>
