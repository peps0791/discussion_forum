				<h2>Review "I'm Done" resulted in "No action needed"</h2>
<p>I just did a review and clicked I'm done. The action displays as No Action Needed. 
This is weird, as I put a comment below the review.</p>

<p>What is wrong?</p>

				<p>I presume you are referring to this review:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/first-posts/54954">https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/first-posts/54954</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Even though you've added a comment, it would appear that you selected the No Action Needed option. Even by 'reviewing' the post by adding a comment, the No Action Needed button is still enabled on the review page. It is possible that you may have accidentally clicked the button instead of the I'm Done button.</p>

<p>Even though you didn't click I'm Done, the review still counts towards both your statistics and as a review (i.e. the review is removed from the queue, unlike the Skip option). Your comment is also unaffected.</p>
