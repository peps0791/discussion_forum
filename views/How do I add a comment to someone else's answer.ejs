<p>I don't know how to add a comment underneath the answer's comments. </p>

<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>At the time you asked this question, you had <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/privileges/user/17156">28 reputation points with these privileges</a>. You can always comment on your own posts, but to <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/privileges/comment">comment on other people's posts</a>, you need 50 reputation points.</p>

<p>However, "me too" and "thanks" posts are unnecessary altogether on this site. Once someone has 15 reputation points, they can say thank you the Stack Exchange way: if you find an answer helpful, you can click the up arrow next to a post to say "thank you" or that you agree. This is called <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/privileges/vote-up">voting up</a>, and it's the <a href="http://apple.blogoverflow.com/2012/03/vote-vote-vote/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">thing to do</a> if you find an answer helpful.</p>
