				<h2>Why were a whole bunch of users just awarded the Vox Populi badge on meta?</h2>
<p>I've only cast three votes on meta this week, and yet I was just awarded the Vox Populi badge. I see there was a spate of awarding this particular badge, but I haven't noticed a spate of meta voting.</p>

				<h3>Score ::3</h3>
				<p><p>We just deployed a change that affects the voting badges.  This is why you see a number of these badges being awarded.</p>

<p>For more information about this change, you can see <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/123048/140548">this answer</a>.</p>

<p>Note that there was a bug with Vox Populi only that awarded too many of them (beyond the expected more for retroactive awards) and a fix has been deployed.  The erroneous awards have been cleaned up.</p>
