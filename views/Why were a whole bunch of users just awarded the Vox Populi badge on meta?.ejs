<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>We just deployed a change that affects the voting badges.  This is why you see a number of these badges being awarded.</p>

<p>For more information about this change, you can see <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/123048/140548">this answer</a>.</p>

<p>Note that there was a bug with Vox Populi only that awarded too many of them (beyond the expected more for retroactive awards) and a fix has been deployed.  The erroneous awards have been cleaned up.</p>
