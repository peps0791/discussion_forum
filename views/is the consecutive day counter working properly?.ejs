				<h2>is the consecutive day counter working properly?</h2>
<p>I have been visiting Apple.SO every day throughout the day including yesterday, and today I see the counter has gone from about 15 down to 1 :-( This is the second time it has happened (last time I was up to 13) so its beginning to bug me.</p>

				<p><p>You may be falling on the wrong side of when the server rolls over between days - the day changes at midnight GMT (10 AM in Brisbane, 8 PM EST) so if you don't visit between 10 AM today and 10 AM tomorrow you won't have visited for 24 hours despite having visited once each day (eg. 9:30 AM today and say noon tomorrow).</p>

<p>Check out <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/61007/consecutive-day-count-reset-this-morning">Consecutive Day count reset this morning</a> on MSO for a similar situation.</p>

<p>Also, just visiting the front page isn't always enough to make it count.</p>

				<p>Sucks to be me then :-( I would really appreciate a change in the way that bit of functionality works, because at the moment I feel like its screwing me over.</p>
