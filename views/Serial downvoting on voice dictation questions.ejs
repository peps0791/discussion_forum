				<h2>Serial downvoting on voice dictation questions</h2>
<p>I've just noticed that I got downvoted on my voice dictation questions:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4O0UW.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Are voice dictation questions out of scope here? If not, is there any other issues with my  voice dictation questions?</p>

				<p><p>Those questions are not only on topic, but I view them as good ones. My guess is someone doesn't like questions about third party products.</p>

<p>I'll watch for vote patterns, but so far nothing is in "moderator needs to act" range. If you see two dozens of votes, please flag a post or bump this again and we can see if there is a pattern that would merit intervention.</p>

<p>You are clearly trying to use OS X software and hardware to do some useful automation and voice recognition. I hope a few cranky votes don't put you off on the site.</p>

				<p>Sounds good, thanks. I'm new on this SE so I essentially wanted to make sure the questions were all right. The serial downvoting got reversed, then was performed again, we'll see how it goes..</p>

				<p>Seems someone didn't like them all appearing all at once & got trigger happy. I thought they were good questions too, no reason to downvote. I'm glad they all bounced back.</p>

				<p>The system reversed one person't votes as part of the daily vote checks. Seems like things are working as intended to me...</p>

				<p>@bmike Actually the guy did serial downvoted a few minutes after his first serial downvote got reversed: the second serial downvote didn't get reversed.</p>

				<p>@FranckDernoncourt Have a look at http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/126829 serial voting is defined as 20 to 100 votes in a day usually. People are allowed to vote down bad answers - so it's a matter of how many and how quickly in most cases. You got three down votes by the looks of things in your screen shot.</p>

				<p>@bmike and 3 more very suspicious downvotes today...</p>

				<p>@FranckDernoncourt I noticed that today. All the question you've asked have been downvoted specifically.</p>
