<p>However, it really took me a while just to get there! <strong>I simply could not find a link.</strong></p>

<p><strong>How come the blog is so hardly accessible? What can we do about this?</strong></p>

<p>I vote for creating a placeholder at the top - next to review, chat, meta, about and faq.</p>

<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>I will note that in the current implementation, a 'blog' link is added to the header navigation with a 'NEW' stamp next to it for 24 hours following a new post on the Ask Different blog. But after that 24 hours? Poof. Back to only the footer.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> Per Rebecca Chernoff's comment, blog links on the main site go to the <a href="http://apple.blogoverflow.com" rel="nofollow">Ask Different blog</a> where blog links on the meta site go to the <a href="http://blog.stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange blog</a>.</p>
