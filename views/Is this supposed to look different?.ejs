<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UNKPH.png" alt="New bar"></p>

<p>Is this supposed to be here? It doesn't fit with the colour scheme of Ask Different, and it appeared recently, without warning or explanation (that I could find).</p>

				<p>Not sure if the bug tag is 100% fitting, but it seemed to be the best of the necessary tags.</p>

				<p>This is intentional and temporary.</p>

				<p>This should be permanent. I really like the dash of colors.</p>

				<p>For a split second I actually thought SE was acquired by Google.   But after reading the news I see the intended symbolism. *Kudos!* for the design.</p>

				<p>I think the colors look nice. It reminds me of Apple's old logo.</p>

				<p><p>It's the colors of the original Apple Logo: </p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eVZlf.jpg" alt="Apple Logo"></p>

<p>It appeared with the update to the site design that added the "Steve Jobs passed away on October 5th, 2011. Rest in peace." line to the top.</p>

				<p>I did recognize the colours, but I wanted to be sure that it was intentional. The colour change actually happened afterwards, about 1 hour ago I was on here, had a normal menu bar, but the Steve Jobs update was there.</p>

				<p>@Mahnax yeah, it took a little while to make and deploy the design change</p>
