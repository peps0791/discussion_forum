	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>I did see a bunch of questions on this topic. And I saw an answer saying that it is fine if they say the source is from AD. Though <a href="http://osquestions.com/osx-ios/151586/how-do-i-hide-the-spotlight-icon-on-yosemite-but-keep-the-spotlight-functionali" rel="nofollow">here</a> it look just as if the AD question was native to the site OSquestions. The whole thread is copied with the questions and answers. Though there are no authors listed. Does anyone know about this? Is it even <strong>Legal</strong> to do that without saying that it is from AD? What should I (or someone) do with this?</p>

<p>Within browsing around, alot of questions are copied from AD. There is also a Unix and Linux tab that could copy.</p>
