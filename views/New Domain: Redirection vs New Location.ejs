				<h2>New Domain: Redirection vs New Location</h2>
<p>Is <a href="http://askdifferent.com">askdifferent.com</a> always going to redirect to <a href="http://apple.stackexchange.com">apple.stakexchange.com</a>?
My understanding was that the site would, like the other graduated SE sites, be accessed and used by our unique domain. I would expect apple.stackexchange.com to redirect to the main site on askdifferent.com.</p>

<p>Is that on the way, or am I missing something?</p>

				<p><p>I honestly trust it will eventually graduate to <a href="http://askdifferent.com">askdifferent.com</a>, I can't see why not.</p>

<p>But I'd love to see <a href="http://superuser.stackexchange.com" rel="nofollow">superuser.stackexchange.com</a> and every other chain site over the same domain just to facilitate google searches. Picture being able to simply do this search on <strong>google:</strong></p>

				<p><p>The backstory of this one is a bit long and sordid, I will freely admit that this answer is probably not one from a neutral viewpoint. I am human, and I do have my opinion too. Note also that I'm going to leave out a LOT of details. This is something you could write a <code>... for dummies</code> book on.</p>

<p>A Long Time Ago, on a web network not very far away...</p>

<p>The StackExchange team wanted to grow in topic scope, and Area51 was a way to engage the community for topics that could be judged on the merit of traffic and participation (and quality... and [...]).</p>

<p>While in beta, Web Applications was hosted at <a href="http://webapps.stackexchange.com">webapps.stackexchange.com</a>. The "Big 7 Meta Questions" on all beta sites included:</p>

<ul>
<li>What should our domain name be?</li>
<li>What should our logo look like?</li>
<li>What should our 404/500 pages look like?</li>
</ul>

<p>I think moderators pro tem were in there, and some other that I don't really remember.</p>

<p>Flash forward to nearing graduation, and the community had very highly <a href="https://webapps.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/108/what-should-our-com-domain-name-be">accepted Nothing to Install as it's domain name</a>.</p>

<p>One cold October afternoon was met with a great hurrah as "Nothing To Install has graduated from Area51 and has been accepted as an official StackExchange Network Site!". Before the day was done, as a result of key communication events (users responding to Joel's announcement on Twitter claiming the domain name "conveyed no meaning").</p>

<p>Thus, the logo was reverted from the pointed "Nothing to Install", to the boring "Web Applications" one. The theme/color scheme, etc. remained the same. Instead of webapps.stackexchange.com redirecting to nothingtoinstall.com , nothingtoinstall.com redirected to webapps.stackexchange.com , and a couple flamewars and huge discussions broke out (among more sensible ones too). On meta.webapps and meta.so.</p>

<p>Needless to say, since that day, while every(?) graduate has a cute name associated with it, and likely an actual domain name, none of them get a non-generic title to go with it<sup>1</sup>. (This is the reason why we had the "Apple Community Moderator Election" and not the "Ask Different Community Moderator Election", btw.)</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>1</sup> AskUbuntu is the exception because it is not solely the property of StackExchange. I do believe Canonical plays a role on the site in some capacity beyond being an official Answering presence.</p>
