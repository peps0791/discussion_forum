				<h2>Process for Flaging a Moderator comment</h2>
<p>If I flag a Moderator comment (as not constructive), does it get reviewed by another (independent) moderator or can the flagged moderator just delete/ignore it.</p>

<p>Just interested in the process here, since none of us is perfect and can make mistakes.</p>

<p>Here is a example (removed moderator name for privacy).</p>

				<p><p>They'll show up in the comment queue and all moderators will see the flag. The system doesn't hide the flag from the moderator who's comment was flagged. We discuss flags on our own comments and avoid moderating ourselves.</p>

				<p>I like the "avoid moderating ourselves", glad to hear there is more then the "accused" seen the Flag. Avoiding the embarrassing Et tu, Brute!-- "Truth will ultimately prevail where there is pains to bring it to light."</p>

				<p>To say occurrences of moderators having comments flagged is rare is an understatement.</p>

				<p>Nobody is perfect ! but also shall not have the ultimate power of deciding his/her faith.</p>
