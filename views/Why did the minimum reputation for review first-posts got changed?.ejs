				<h2>Why did the minimum reputation for review first-posts got changed?</h2>
<p>Till last week, I reviewed both first-post and late-answers. today, I can't. It says that <em>the users with 500 reputation can only review</em>.</p>

<p>When did this happen?</p>

				<p>The why was apparently decided during a close look at all the privileges that happened last week on a network wide basis. </p>

</ul>

<p>There was some discussion that this review would be better placed at 1k or even higher, but on sites like ours with lower voting - the bump to 500 removed a larger fraction of total reviewers than on sites like stack overflow. </p>
