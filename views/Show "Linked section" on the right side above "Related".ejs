				<h2>Show "Linked section" on the right side above "Related"</h2>
<p>Stackoverflow, Stackoverflow meta and other StackExchange sites have "Linked section" on the right side above "Related".</p>

<p>However it seems not visible on apple.stackexchange.com. E.g. <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/95761/how-to-convert-from-evernote-rich-text-to-markdown-on-ipad">How to convert from evernote rich text to markdown on IPad?</a> has a link to <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/13283/is-it-possible-to-copy-rich-text-formatting-on-iphone">Is it possible to copy &#39;rich text&#39; formatting on iPhone?</a>, but no "Linked section".</p>

<p>Don't be different, please show it.</p>

				<p>I don't think we're different. I see a Linked Section in my view of that question you linked to. See: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/jho6rKI)</p>

				<p>@IanC, I can see it now, but it wasn't visible  10 minutes later after the question was submitted. It seems that   delay in populating "linked" section is essential</p>

				<p><p>The code that detects and draws the linked section executes a bit after a post is submitted, so you may not see that field immediately upon posting a new question or submitting an edit to a question/answer. </p>

<p>The posts you have indicated all have a linked section at present, so perhaps you had a cached copy of those pages or viewed them before the code to assemble the links had been triggered or had finished executing?</p>
