	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>Next to comments there are two options - one is to flag it, the other is an up arrow ("this is a great comment"). Other then letting users know which comments are valuable, do  the up arrows "votes" have any other role?</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>The only other function they serve is that, in cases where a question or answer has many comments, and the displayed list is abridged and the <strong>Add/Show x More Comments</strong> link appears, up votes are used to determine which contents remain displayed while others are hidden.</p>

<p>Beyond that, it has no other mechanical effect, other than providing a visual indicator to other users that some number of people thought a given comment was worthy of additional attention in some way.</p>
