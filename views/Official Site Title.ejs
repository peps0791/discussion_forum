				<h2>Official Site Title</h2>
<p>Hi all. I have some exciting news to share. A design for the official Apple.se site is in the works!</p>

<p>I need to ask the community what the final text in the header logo should be. Right now it's just "Apple." I feel it's a bit incomplete. Would "Apple Q&amp;A" make more sense?</p>

<p>I'm open for suggestions. </p>

				<p>@Dori, thanks! I have seen the logo thread. I think since Apple dropped the rainbow colors in 1998, it may not reflect of Apple of today. Also for SE site logos, we don't need to make it look like the SE logo. I think the   symbol may be more fitting. It has an interesting backstory too: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_key#The_origin_of_.22.E2.8C.98.22</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-379" class = "comment">
				<p>@Dori What would be bad about using  ? I don't think people are going to refer to it by name, so it shouldn't matter if there are multiple names for it.</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-389" class = "comment">
				<p>@dori but hasn't the rainbow apple icon been obsolete for a solid decade now? Also, we're looking for something people in that community will recognize, like a secret handshake. The words "Stack Overflow", for example, are meaningless to the 99.9% of people who aren't programmers.</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-390" class = "comment">
				<p>@dori: I've stayed out of this debate since my suggestion of   until now, but the reason why I didn't vote for the rainbow logo is for exactly the first reason that @Jeff states. I love my collection of OS 9 and earlier Macs, but those days are long gone. The reason why I suggested   is because it has been on every Mac since the first, the Mac is a cornerstone of Apple's product line (we can't develop for the iOS properly without a Mac), and it is still on the keyboard today;   has outlasted the rainbow-themed logo.</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-391" class = "comment">
				<p>Oops, it seems I did vote for a rainbow logo, the one currently with four votes. Personally, I'm fine with whatever the community decides here. All of the designs are great so far (Programmers.SE is my current favorite of the sites I visit), so I'm sure whatever is done will look just fine.</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-394" class = "comment">
				<p>After having thought of this a bit more, I have to say I'm stumped.  Not to state the plainly obvious, if we use  , we will incur the wrath of Apple's legal eagles. If we use the spectrum, probably not so much, but I don't think it really says "Apple" like it used to; the logo has always been really about the silhouette, I've always thought. Also, I thought one of the requirements was to have something that would work in one color as well, and in that case the spectrum simply won't work.</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-395" class = "comment">
				<p>If memory serves   has outlasted every icon in Apple's existence, and has only recently *not* been included in Apple products on such a large scale. I'm sure if used in a context with Apple, we still run the same low risk, but still a risk, as the spectrum. I don't recall there being other "branded" SE site like this one, but I'd be curious to know how this scenario has been handled if there is one.</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-396" class = "comment">
				<p>I do not think, however, that having   as the logo will cause the site to narrow its focus to just the Macintosh line, especially if we use "Apple" somewhere in the *by-line* for the site (i.e., "Ask Different: Apple Q&A For The Rest Of Us" (hey, I kind of like that)), then that would fall into the fair use clause of copyright, and it makes it clear to all newcomers that this is for Apple questions and not just Macs (though I think that if we did actually narrow the focus people would ask whatever they wanted anyway).</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-398" class = "comment">
				<p>@Dori: It seems to me that the crux of the problem is that there are no longer really any icons in the Apple "iconosphere" that are   universal to all products outside of     that also make sense for a Q&A site and   won't get us into possible legal mires. There are odd bits like System Preferences and Apple applications like iTunes that reach across the two OSes, but that's it. I don't think   is perfect either, but we have little else to go on. As for the downvoting, you really ought to consider the source (when you can) in that particular case. That is a great cheat sheet.</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-399" class = "comment">
				<p>@Dori: One more thing, the spectrum logo I did vote for in the other thread was the one that made a whole icon as opposed to stripes (the one that's most popular) solely for the reason that in one color, the striped one would look exactly like the SE family logo, and adding in the   to compensate for that is out of the question (I think we would both agree).</p>

				<p>@dori: also, try not to take it personal, you also got **8** upvotes for that post including mine :)  everyone isn't always going to agree or even be nice, but it is the internet after all... that parts probably never going to change :)  At least you don't have an entire meta post dedicated to what a jerk you are like I do.</p>

			<div id = "comment-406" class = "comment">
				<p>@Dori and others, I've enjoyed this debate. I think looking at the site design as a whole package, it needs to emote and reflect the theme of the site. The level of graphical details depends on the site's nature. Gaming has more, and Statistics has less. I try to find that fine balance. I want new users who come to the site to get "this is an Apple" site right away and veteran users enjoy the design as they provide valuable content. The logo is only part of this whole package. We all agree that we can't use  , even a variation of it may get us in legal trouble. that's why I think   is [...]</p>

				<p>[...] the next most recognizable symbol. Speaking of the design, occasionally I ask my respected designer friends to help out. The English site turned out great. For the Apple site, I've asked Mike Rundle of http://flyosity.com I feel he's more qualified to do the site than I. We talked about the creative direction, we both agreed it needs to reflect the Apple theme clearly, though may not explicitly copy all the Apple design elements. I'm very confident that he'll come up with a great design. I'll post it as soon as I receive it.</p>

				<p>I can't see where it originated, but the current tagline *Answers for your Apple questions* works very nicely for me. In general I hate taglines, but with the pleasantly short simple title **Ask Different** it works very well.</p>

				<p><p><b>Ask</b>Apple </p>

<p>Much better than the only somewhat related current title. The chiefly title is like the AskUbuntu site being called AskPerfection. </p>

<p><b>Ask</b>Apple means the user knows exactly what the site is about straight away. And it fits better with existing stackexchange sites (AskUbuntu) and also stackexchange sites haven't really changed their title when going out of beta. 
Also the URL of the site matches the title much more than currently. Now it's like if Google changed their name but didn't change any of the domain names. </p>
