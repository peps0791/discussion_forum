	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>I have posted a short blog entry about a change to the site scope to announce the allowing of beta questions.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://apple.blogoverflow.com/2015/08/beta-ios-9-and-el-capitan-questions-allowed/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://apple.blogoverflow.com/2015/08/beta-ios-9-and-el-capitan-questions-allowed/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In the past, it would show up promptly in the sidebar / community bulletin area. So far, it's a no show. </p>

<p>Do I need to do something specific to allow that or has that been changed intentionally over time?</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>I ended up "abusing" the "community event" tool to promote the blog post for one week.</p>

<p>Other than the pedantic argument that it's not an event, it seems to be working well.</p>
