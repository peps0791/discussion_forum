	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>Although I'm pretty liberal about most things, a new user, <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/111822/rectumrectifier">rectumrectifier</a>, has a name which is a little childish, if not mildly pornographic.</p>

<p>How is this approached by the admins on AskDifferent? Is there a standard for usernames?</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>If you find that something about a user is offensive or inappropriate outside of any particular post, flag any post from that user with a custom flag.</p>

<p>There is more leeway with what is allowed in the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/52443/welbog">About Me section</a> of a user's profile as this requires a click-through, however avatars and names are subject to removal if deemed inappropriate.</p>
