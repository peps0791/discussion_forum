	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>In order to increase the visibility of our site, we may want to start a social media presence. There is now an official <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/StackApple" rel="nofollow">Twitter feed</a></strong> for questions that people can follow and retweet. I've also set up a <strong><a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Apple-Stack-Exchange/154758227909964" rel="nofollow">Facebook page</a></strong> for people being able to 'like' the site and share with their friends.</p>

<p>Are there others that would be useful?</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>FYI, we are instituting standard Twitter feeds for all (public) sites; this feed will auto-populate with an interesting question from the site every ~3 hours.</p>

<p><s>This will be announced next week on the blog with more details so stay tuned</s></p>

<p>This list on wikipedia might be of help to you: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_networking_websites" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_networking_websites</a></p>

<p>Personally I think integration with LinkedIn might be helpful as well - it's nice to let others know that we are sharing our knowledge, and a lot of the people I'm networked with there know a lot about these kind of topics.</p>
