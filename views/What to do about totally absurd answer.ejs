				<h2>What to do about totally absurd answer</h2>
<p>What should you do to an answer that is "No I'm no canfarm wifi bulothot" ? </p>

<p>Should I mark it down as well as flag it? It's not <strong>really</strong> spam.</p>

				<p>The important step in these cases is to flag the post so the moderator team is aware of it. Flagging gives you several options. In cases like the one mentioned in the question</p>
