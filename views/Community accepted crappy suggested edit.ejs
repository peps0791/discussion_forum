				<h2>Community accepted crappy suggested edit</h2>
<p>I came across a rather interesting <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/41068/revisions">revision history</a> of an question, in which was a horrible <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/4418">suggested edit</a> that was accepted by the Community bot.</p>

<p>To be fair, the suggested edit wasn't all bad   the tags it added were fine, but the content edits were mainly changing <code>Macbook</code> to <code>Mac Book</code> and contracting two sentences. In my opinion a rather unnecessary edit, and quite a bad one.</p>

<p>I'm not that informed about how Community reviews suggested edits, but it seems to be doing all right, although this one really wasn't that good. I suggest we tweak it's algorithms to reject edits splitting certain words and product names or even simply rejecting edits with only two characters edited in the main content. <strong>Or simply not allowing community to accept suggested edits at all   there seems to be enough active high-rep users on Ask Different to handle all suggested edits by themselves.</strong></p>

				<p><p>That looks like something from before the redesign of /review. (Or an artifact for when a user's account is deleted). Either way, I've not seen any recent reviews by the community user.</p>

<p>Unless you can point to something more recent, I'm inclined to close this as status-completed at this point. It's fascinating, but likely to be a relic from the past.</p>
