				<h2>Are questions about App Review on-topic?</h2>
<p>Today I encountered <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/251233/apple-rejected-my-app-twice-citing-a-very-grey-area-violation-but-already-hav">this question</a> pertaining to "unfair treatment" by the App Store Review, and whether the OP should "appeal" the decision for his app to be rejected.</p>

<p>Is this kind of question on- or off-topic on this site?</p>

				<p>"Somebody treated me such-and-such, what should I do" is practically always off-topic. OTOH, the linked question can be turned into a "what options do I have if this-and-this fails" question with a small edit which is on-topic usually.</p>
