				<h2>Why can't I make line breaks in my questions~answers?</h2>
<p>When
I'm
writing
something, I naturally use a lot of line breaks. Unfortunately, when I press return once to make a linebreak, it
just
adds
a
space.
I
have
to
press
return
again
for
a
break
to
appear,
and
even
then
only
a
paragraph
break
appears.</p>

<p>In fact, for demonstrative purposes, in the above paragraph, I used 'linebreaks' instead of spaces:<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3pCqU.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>I realise I can use <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> to add line breaks, but this soon becomes cumbersome.</p>

<p>Might I request that:</p>

<ul>
<li>if this is a bug, please fix it?</li>
<li>if this is a missing feature, please could it be added?</li>
</ul>

				<p><p>If you <strong><em>add two spaces</em></strong> after a word and enter a line break/return, the markdown engine will insert a line break automagically. This disables the rewrapping that is designed into the editing system.</p>

<p>So
if 
you
enter
lines
like
this, they wrap.</p>

<p>But<br>
if<br>
you<br>
double<br>
space, then they don't wrap.</p>

<p>This is documented in the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/editing-help">advanced editing help</a> section, which you can get to from any editing frame by clicking the blue circle around the question mark to the right of the edit toolbar.</p>

				<p>That makes sense, though the 'edit' link is greyed out for me so I can't see the source...</p>

				<p>OK, perhaps the revision history will work, but you should be able to test this on your posts. Just use a second space (or more) and see how wrapping changes.</p>

				<p>Does this work or does it time-out (session-specific?) http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/revisions/019a3bc0-8d9e-4bc3-9654-a1f4d04875a7/view-source</p>

				<p>It's no longer necessary, but it doesn't time-out, no. I can still read it, 15 days later, so it must be fine :)</p>
