	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>When
I'm
writing
something, I naturally use a lot of line breaks. Unfortunately, when I press return once to make a linebreak, it
just
adds
a
space.
I
have
to
press
return
again
for
a
break
to
appear,
and
even
then
only
a
paragraph
break
appears.</p>

<p>In fact, for demonstrative purposes, in the above paragraph, I used 'linebreaks' instead of spaces:<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3pCqU.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>I realise I can use <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> to add line breaks, but this soon becomes cumbersome.</p>

<p>Might I request that:</p>

<ul>
<li>if this is a bug, please fix it?</li>
<li>if this is a missing feature, please could it be added?</li>
</ul>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>If you <strong><em>add two spaces</em></strong> after a word and enter a line break/return, the markdown engine will insert a line break automagically. This disables the rewrapping that is designed into the editing system.</p>

<p>So
if 
you
enter
lines
like
this, they wrap.</p>

<p>But<br>
if<br>
you<br>
double<br>
space, then they don't wrap.</p>

<p>This is documented in the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/editing-help">advanced editing help</a> section, which you can get to from any editing frame by clicking the blue circle around the question mark to the right of the edit toolbar.</p>
