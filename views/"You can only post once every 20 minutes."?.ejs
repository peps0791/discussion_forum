				<h2>"You can only post once every 20 minutes."?</h2>
<p>Rare occasion. I actually have two questions about Apple products and it complains<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PhZrz.png" alt="Error message: you can only post once every 20 minutes."></p>

<p>What gives?</p>

<p>I don't quite understand the rationale whichever way I think about it. Even if this is something to deter spammers, am I expected to turn into a spammer on an individual SE site suddenly, although having gained rep on several others already?</p>

<p>To add insult to injury I was handed a CAPTCHA on the last attempt. Perhaps because I kept retrying to post the question? Although, I kept retrying because there is no indication of when the 20 minutes are through?! ;)</p>

				<p>If it helps, I get CAPTCHAs now and then as well, especially while moderating a lot of flagged posts in a short time :-)</p>

				<p>Yes - CAPTCHA's are actually more necessary for high rep users as opposed to low rep users. Imagine the mess that could be caused if a cookie from a moderator were used by a bot.</p>

				<p>@bmike: yes, this is a fact I didn't consider. But that's only the CAPTCHAs and not the posting of questions. Thanks nevertheless for pointing it out. Much appreciated.</p>

				<p><p>It's considered to be a feature, see <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=20+minutes">https://meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=20+minutes</a> for quite a lot of information about this. </p>

<p>The error message should have explained that this limitation is lifted for users with reputation above 125. If that notice wasn't provided, please indicate that and we'll turn this into a bug report.</p>

<p>This behavior is documented at:</p>

<p><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/65423/why-are-low-rep-users-rate-limited-when-posting-questions">Why are low-rep users rate-limited when posting questions?</a></p>

<p>The rational for implementing this feature is covered in this blog post. I think SE is a bit proud that most people don't see the crap that gets posted (or wants to be posted by spammers / scammers / disruptive people) on the sites. </p>

				<p>@0xC0000022L I've added some of the back story on why this is a feature. I agree it would be nice to not hobble people that are here for the right reasons, but I've seen what happens without these controls and it's not pretty.</p>
