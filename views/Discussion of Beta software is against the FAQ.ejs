	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>I had problems with my iOS device, because it was running on iOS 5 Beta 7 and the device became unusable as the Beta expired. I had no idea what to do with it and how to restore it to normal mode, so naturally I turned to Apple SE for help and asked my question. </p>

<p>The question was quickly closed as not appropriate because of the following: </p>

<pre><code> Welcome to Ask Different! Questions about pre release software are off topic for this site. Please take a look at the FAQs for more info. 
</code></pre>

<p>I think the problem itself is a real problem that causes problems to iOS users. I find really disheartening these rules. They are discouraging me from asking questions related to apple. I feel that this rule is somehow in conflict with the sole purpose of the site. </p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>Actually your question was meant to be closed as a duplicate since it was asked earlier already, and that question was left open with the same warning.</p>

<p>The reason we do not allow questions around Beta software, specifically with regard to Apple, is due to the fact that all Apple Beta Software is under a strict NDA that every developer has to agree to when joining the program. Allowing one opens up a whole new set of issues. Also since Apple.SE is a public site, the last thing we need is Apple coming down on the site for allowing NDA material to be publicly released.</p>

<p>I have to be honest, since you brought it up and as a Apple Dev myself, how is it that registered developers are not aware that Betas expire, since every one of the iOS 5 betas did, nor that they were not aware that the GM was released more then 2 weeks ago and almost a week before the public received it to the devs? It bring the legitimacy of the question, in question, on that point alone. This <code>problem</code> will only occur when your a registered Apple Developer or you happened to get a copy of the IPSW of the beta through illegal means, and the latter we do not support, nor should we.</p>

<p>I don't see how this rule is in conflict with the purpose on the site, since there is already more then 95% of question <strong>not related to beta software</strong>?</p>
