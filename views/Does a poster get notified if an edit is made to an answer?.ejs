<p>However, these notifications are not sent for minor edits. Edits need to be substantiative enough for the system to deem it necessary to notify you. For more information, see Meta.SE:</p>

</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order to reduce noise sent to users, we only notify when "substantive" changes are happening on their posts.</p>
  
  <p>There are a few rules in how "substantive" is defined, but typically one of these two should be enough to trigger a message:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>the edit in the post body should be over a threshold</li>
  <li>the edit in code sections should be over another threshold</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The threshold varies from site to site.</p>

<p>Notifications are not sent to the user who asked a question if an answer to their question is edited.</p>
