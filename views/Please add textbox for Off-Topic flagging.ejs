				<h2>Please add textbox for Off-Topic flagging</h2>
<p>I just wanted to flag <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/126842/wi-fi-network-created-but-not-shown-on-other-devices">https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/126842/wi-fi-network-created-but-not-shown-on-other-devices</a> as being off-topic for not running on Apple hardware.</p>

<p>But there's no option for it.</p>

<p>However, the other question of this user has been put <strong>on-hold</strong> for this off-topic reason.</p>

<p>Why is it a reason, but can't I flag for it?</p>

				<p>Here is how I would expect a user to handle that question: </p>

<ol>
<li>Select the close reason (it's better to just close than flag if you have that option)</li>
<li>&nbsp; <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kcZcM.png" alt="Closing"></li>
<li>Select either unclear (it could after all still be about Apple hardware or software and need an edit to clarify the link) or off-topic using the default close reason about scope as documented in the [help]. </li>
<li>&nbsp; <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d3gc8.png" alt="Flagging &gt; Closing"></li>
<li>Close for other:</li>
<li>&nbsp; <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FFB5g.png" alt="Flagging &gt; Closing &gt; Off-Topic"></li>
</ol>

<p>I'll ping the SE employees to ask if the last picture above can get coded to include the custom close reason text with a radio button to indicate simply that <strong>This question does not appear to be about Apple hardware or software within the scope defined in the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic">help center</a>.</strong></p>

<p>As things are coded, you might need to choose "Other" and copy/paste or re-type the default close reason. Here's something you can copy below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question does not appear to be about Apple hardware or software within the scope defined in the [help center](<a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic">https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic</a>).</p>

				<p>We removed the "Other" option for users who don't yet have the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/close-questions">cast close votes</a> privilege. Trusting folks who haven't yet gained the system's trust to even <em>know</em> what's on- and off-topic, much less write helpful comments to this end, is pretty risky. </p>

<p>Removing the option to flag <em>blatantly</em> off-topic stuff isn't great either though. I tend to think the best option here would be to just add an "other" option <em>without</em> offering the chance to enter a comment. </p>

<p>Until we get around to doing that, you can back out to the main flag dialog and choose "other (needs   moderator attention)" and just explain the problem there.</p>
