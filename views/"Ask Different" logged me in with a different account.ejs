				<h2>"Ask Different" logged me in with a different account</h2>
<p>I created another user account on my computer, and visited <em>Ask Different</em>. I logged in using the same username I normally use (and I am using now), but despite I used the same ClaimID OpenID account, it shows me as <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/6434/kiamlaluno">user6474</a>.</p>

<p>I tried from my other Mac, using the similar user account I have on my Mac Mini, but I am still logged in as user6474.</p>

<p>To show that it's an account to which I have access, I am going to rename the account, and use kiamlaluno also on the new account.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I tried logging in on <em>Stack Overflow</em> from the other computer, and it reports the following message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This OpenID is new to Stack Overflow:<br>
  ClaimID (kiamlaluno)</p>
  
  <p>However, it is know to 1 other sites in the Stack Exchange Network</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To try logging in on <em>Stack Overflow</em>, I have used Google Chrome, instead of Safari, and I don't understand why I get that message.<br>
I should not see that message, as I am using the same OpenID account I am using on this computer. I don't understand the reason why SE thinks it's a new account when I use it from a different computer and a different local user account.</p>

				<p>Of course, I could not add the email address, as it's the same I am already using for my normal account.</p>

			<div id = "comment-952" class = "comment">
				<p>I updated the user profile link, as it was not correct anymore, since I have set kiamlaluno as showed name. I still have to understand why using a different Mac account to log in on SE would cause any problem, but that is what happens.</p>

				<p><p>Hm, from what I can tell they really are both using the same OpenID. This is likely a bug in Stack Exchange. If you're looking to regain access to your original account, I suggest using <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/account-recovery">email account recovery</a> for the time being.</p>

				<p>It doesn't work; it reports me the ClaimID account I am using, and then tells me to log in, but I am still being logged in with the wrong account. I will try deleting any cookies on the other computer, to see if it works.</p>

				<p>@kiamlaluno If that doesn't work, there are basically two options - you can contact the SE team directly (team+apple@stackexchange.com) and see what they can do for you, or I can merge your old account into your new account.</p>

				<p>I will try contacting them; you could merge the accounts, but I could still have the same problem when I try to log in from the other computer. I will try to copy the cookies between the accounts, if there is a way to do that on a Mac. Thank you for helping.</p>

				<p>@Kyle Cronin It seems I have resolved my issue; may you delete the account #6434?</p>

				<p>@kiamlaluno OK, done</p>

				<p>the issue is that claimid supports two forms of their OpenID -- they are not the same from our perspective, they are different strings. You can search meta.so for more detail, etc</p>
