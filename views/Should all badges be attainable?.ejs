				<h2>Should all badges be attainable?</h2>
<p>I looked at <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/13/should-the-beta-badges-stop-being-awarded-to-users">SO meta</a>, and they have removed the badge for participating in the beta.</p>

<p>I think that all the badges should be attainable for everyone, so badges like Beta and precognative. </p>

<p>I do understand that these are a medal and people are proud to ahve them but can these be incorporated into the profile rather than a badge, as no newer users will ever have the chance of gaining these badges.</p>

				<h2>Answer</h2>
				<h3>Score ::6</h3>
				<p><p>There are a number of badges which are practically unattainable for various reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>"participated in Beta" -> obvious</li>
<li>"Legendary" (Earned 200 daily reputation 150 times) -> maybe in a few years</li>
<li>"Reversal" (Provided answer of +20 score to a question of -5 score) -> how likely is that?</li>
</ul>

<p>So I think one unattainable badge more or less doesn't matter.</p>

				<p>These can ultimately be achieved over time. The ones i have mentioned are absolutely unattainable from now onwards, there is no point in having them.</p>

				<p>So? Let the beta users have their badge, there are more than enough badges to go for remaining :-)</p>

				<p>have the badge but why list it, if it cannot be achieved?</p>

				<p>@GraemeHutchison, do you mean to list it on people's profiles, but not on the [list of badges](http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/badges)?</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-1741" class = "comment">
				<p>@Daniel yes, either list it as a badge or as something else, on the profile, and remove it from the list of attainable badges.</p>
