				<h2>Are iPhone App Requests On Topic?</h2>
<p>I'm looking specifically at this proposal: <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/22647/theres-an-app-for-that-iphone-apps">There's an app for that (iPhone apps)</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Proposed Q&amp;A site for people who want to find and discuss iPhone apps. The app store is not a friendly place to search: this site would allow discussion of apps based on merit (user experience, feature set, ease of use) and allow finding by topic (eg shopping list apps). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on the description and the on-topic questions, would that content be welcomed on this site?</p>

<p>Please discuss.</p>
