				<p><p>You can already receive desktop notifications with this app: <a href="https://stackapps.com/questions/3081/senotifier-a-stack-exchange-inbox-notifier-for-mac-os-x">https://stackapps.com/questions/3081/senotifier-a-stack-exchange-inbox-notifier-for-mac-os-x</a></p>

<p>It's not integrated with the notification center, but has growl support.</p>

<p>Or, you can use this other app <a href="https://stackapps.com/questions/1993/newt-question-answer-and-comment-and-rep-change-notifications-for-mac-os-x">https://stackapps.com/questions/1993/newt-question-answer-and-comment-and-rep-change-notifications-for-mac-os-x</a></p>

				<p>Desktop Notifications specifically is a Notification Center feature. I would rather have it integrated.</p>

				<p>@duci9y Considering that StackExchange is not only a Apple Q&A but also various other systems sharing the same codebase, I doubt there wil be a huge push for an Apple only feature to be implemented when there is a huge amount of other new feature that need to be completed.</p>

				<p>Many Stack Exchange users use OS X to access the site. And it is a very simple but important feature.</p>
