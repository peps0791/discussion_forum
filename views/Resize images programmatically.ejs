				<h2>Resize images programmatically</h2>
<p>For editing purposes, is there a way to resize the images on this website without saving them to your computer, resize them an upload them again? </p>

<p>I've played with some x and y coordinates, but with no luck... </p>

				<p>Yes - I believe changing the embed from <code>![]</code> to <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> and specifying size x and y works to keep the original image intact yet display a smaller version. I have asked for this to be automated, but it doesn't appear to be getting many up votes. (it's a long question - not so sharp - perhaps it's time to edit it down and ask on the main meta site)</p>

<p>So in the mean time, you can edit a post and place <code>&lt;img ... width="300" /&gt;</code> and use the <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1777/what-html-tags-are-allowed-on-stack-exchange-sites">strict subset</a> of html that is allowed. You can always summon this list from the blue help icon when editing.</p>
