				<h2>Is it ok to "reuse" or plagiarize comments when reviewing first questions?</h2>
<p>I've seen this comment by <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/85275/tetsujin">Tetsujin</a> on non-answers and rants:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>and I thought it was great and copied it to some first posts I was reviewing  I even added markdown links for them to work when pasted to the comment box. </p>

<p>Is that ok? Should I credit <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/85275/tetsujin">Tetsujin</a>? Are there canned responses available to higher rep users that are not available to me (~750)?</p>

				<p>I just gathered all the canned responses as I saw them & copy/pasted to a local file, which I keep open as I'm going through review queues. That particular one, I'm sure I got from @grgarside in the first place anyway, with the added 'welcome' for new users.</p>

				<p>Even as a 10k user you don't always get the option to send a canned response - Late Answers, for instance don't have a 'vote to close' but must be flagged for non-answers, so that's when the copy/paste comes in handy - an example [though I'm not sure if you'll be able to see it] http://apple.stackexchange.com/review/late-answers/117083</p>

				<p>It was George's list really, tweaked from the canned responses, though his page seems to have vanished. Let me flag him to this comment & see if there's potential for its reappearance - @grgarside</p>

<p>The text you selected is a canned response in the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/review">/review queue</a> that you'll earn once you reach that <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges">reputation milestone</a>.</p>
