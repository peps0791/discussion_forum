	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>If you look at all the chat rooms on SE, (notwithstanding the temporary ones between users etc) they pretty much all have a) a witty name, and/or b) some following subtext, e.g. :</p>

<p>The Frying Pan: Sometimes hot, always heavy. (cooking.SE)</p>

<p>Literature: Read any good books lately? (literature.SE)</p>

<p>Many of them have a generic "General discussion for XXX.stackexchange.com" subtext.</p>

<p>Ours is blank.  Can we set one?  Suggestions as answers, most upvotes after a week wins?</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>Warning: I'm not good at naming things.</p>

<p>What came to mind for a name is <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appletalk" rel="nofollow">AppleTalk</a></strong>.<br>
I'm not convinced that this is a great option, since it's pretty obscure.<br>
That said, it may be better than nothing (maybe?).</p>


<p><strong>Chat Different</strong> (notice the space) as the room name, with the subtext line reading "Here's to the crazy ones"</p>

<p>Because the whole "Think Different" campaign launched with the reflection:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers.
  The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things
  differently. They re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for
  the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or
  vilify them. About the only thing you can t do is ignore them. Because
  they change things. They invent. They imagine. They heal. They
  explore. They create. They inspire. They push the human race forward.
  Maybe they have to be crazy. How else can you stare at an empty canvas
  and see a work of art? Or sit in silence and hear a song that s never
  been written? Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels?
  We make tools for these kinds of people. While some see them as the
  crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to
  think they can change the world, are the ones who do.</p>

<p>For a chat room name, absent a really eloquent play on words ("The iLounge"), I think "Ask Different Chat" is sufficient for now<sup>1</sup>. I admit that I love the originality of other sites' room names, and would love to get there eventually, but I don't think we have it yet.</p>

<p>Per my comment on Daniel's answer, the best subtext is easily "The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers." or maybe slightly abuse the quote:</p>

<p>"The crazy ones; The misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers."</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Unless folks feel like rallying around "Ask Different Magpies" :D!</p>


<p>For the room name, I personally like "<strong>One more thing...</strong>"</p>

<p>I haven't got a preference for the subtext yet, but I'm resisting up voting the "misfits" ones as I think it's a bit of a relic</p>


<p>I think that "Ask Different Chat" is sufficient for the <em>primary</em> chat of the site, but feel free to create your own themed chats.</p>
