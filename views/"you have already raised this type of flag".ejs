				<h2>"you have already raised this type of flag"</h2>
<p>Does that mean I already raised it on this particular post but forgot, or that I've used up my day's ration of this type of flag?<br>
  or something else?</p>

<p>I've seen it twice today, but wasn't paying close enough attention to what may have caused it. I certainly didn't think I'd raised enough flags for the system to limit me.</p>

				<p><p>Without details, I would trust that you actually flagged that specific post already.</p>

<p>The message for "go away" due to no flags left is different.</p>

<p>However, if the code burps, you could get these when the conditions are not present. Hard to say for sure unless it continues.</p>

				<p>I'd guessed it may have been a hiccup. I was trying to look back through the queues & find which one it was, but no joy. Re patrix's comment, I'll link if I see one again.</p>

				<p><p>This was a bug. Generally, the error message is meant to show if you've flagged the post before, but a bug caused this to break. <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/248107/222623">This is now fixed.</a></p>

				<p>Aha - nice find. Thought it felt like a bug, but once I'd really spotted what happened, I never saw it again that day to test the theory.</p>
