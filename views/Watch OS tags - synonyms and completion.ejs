				<h2>Watch OS tags - synonyms and completion</h2>
<p>I was looking at new tags and noticed these ones <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/watchos" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;watchos&#39;" rel="tag">watchos</a> and <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/watch" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;watch&#39;" rel="tag">watch</a>. I thought there must be one already there and the main entry seems to be <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/apple-watch" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;apple-watch&#39;" rel="tag">apple-watch</a> with synonyms including <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/watch-os" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;watch-os&#39;" rel="tag">watch-os</a>.</p>

<p>This seems reasonable except for two issues</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Shouldn't there be a difference tag for the hardware and the OS? I suspect this has been discussed so point me to where.</p></li>
<li><p>The main point of this post. If you create or edit an entry and start typing a tag watch  ... then  you get no completion and so we will get many new tags here i.e. the  <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/watchos" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;watchos&#39;" rel="tag">watchos</a> and <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/watch" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;watch&#39;" rel="tag">watch</a> Given the synonyms already here we want <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/watch-os" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;watch-os&#39;" rel="tag">watch-os</a> to show in the completions. Why does it not show. If we can't get this bug fixed and we have <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/watchos" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;watchos&#39;" rel="tag">watchos</a> added to the synonyms</p></li>
</ol>

				<p>I agree and I think we should follow the same practice that we use for iPhone and iOS. Thus we should have at a high level <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/apple-watch" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;apple-watch&#39;" rel="tag">apple-watch</a> for hardware and <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/watchos" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;watchos&#39;" rel="tag">watchos</a> for software. Also we should have break downs for watchOS so there should be <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/watchos-1" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;watchos-1&#39;" rel="tag">watchos-1</a> and <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/watchos-2" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;watchos-2&#39;" rel="tag">watchos-2</a>, just like iOS. The only issue I see is that down-cased watchOS is a little hard to read.</p>

<p>Also I don't see why <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/workout.app" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;workout.app&#39;" rel="tag">workout.app</a> is a synonym of <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/apple-watch" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;apple-watch&#39;" rel="tag">apple-watch</a>. That needs to be fixed too.</p>
