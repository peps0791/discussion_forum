				<h2>Answers that are really comments~comments that are really answers</h2>
<p>In the flagging dialog box, there is a way to indicate that an answer is not really an answer, but actually a comment.</p>

<p>What about the reverse case? Are flags encouraged that indicate that a comment is actually an answer to the problem? If we read comments that actually propose a solution to the problem, should we flag them as "not a comment" for a moderator to reclassify as an answer?</p>

<p>Sure, but it would be faster to simply <code>@</code> the commenter and tell them to make their comment an answer. That's what we would do; it is all we <em>can</em> do, per my answer to your second question.</p>

<p>We do not have the ability to switch comments to answers; we can only switch answers to comments (and I've done that a fair number of times). All we can do in that case is simply <code>@</code> the commenter to ask them to add their comment as an answer. Veterans of Stack Exchange typically oblige, but people new to the culture typically don't and we are stuck.</p>

				<p>That was my core question: I knew you had the ability to turn answers into comments, and didn't know if you had the reverse superpower.</p>

				<p>I've thought the same thing. It's kind of an awkward social situation. There's a nice answer there for the posting - so that it fits "our" vision of how the site should be structured, but we are trained to not speak for others - let them get credit for their "answer".</p>
