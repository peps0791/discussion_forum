				<h2>Site design update</h2>
<p>As you can see, Ask Different community site got a slight design update today. I have moved site's CSS to a newly refactor LESS system, so it's easier for us to fix SE network CSS bugs globally going on forward. Also I've updated site's logo and icons to SVG for retina support. Visually it should "feel" the same as the old site, but with updated Apple aesthetics(yes, I did flatten all the things). I have retired Lucida Sans for Helvetica.</p>

<p>This update should retro-actively fix most of the old CSS bugs. If you see any new ones, or old ones not being fixed, please let me know!</p>

<p>P.S. I can't believe it's been over 4 years since AD launched. Here's the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/H9Q9b7V.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">original design</a> when the site first launched.</p>

				<p>Awesome! Thank you! Looks snazzy.</p>

				<p>That's great, but I noticed that with the new updates, the designs of sites become less and less unique. Now the fonts are the same everywhere, the vote buttons, favorite button and The Checkmark are the same everywhere, only color differs in active state. Elements are now aligned with no difference on all the new sites and the sites with recently updated design. The only major difference between those sites is logo and, in some places, color scheme (and metas are almost indistinguishable, if I can't see the logo). Ah yes. Tag designs also differ a bit.</p>

			<div id = "comment-4432" class = "comment">
				<p>@nicael We only make visual changes when needed, sites should still retain their individual style. We did standardize icons when they don't affect the overall look and feel of the site. In the case of Ask Different, I used Helvetica because that's what Apple uses for the latest OS now. Some elements are more standardize now, e.g. tags and badges because they'd reduce layout issues across the network.</p>

				<p>@Jin Yes and the question titles all appear to be overwhelmed by the white background - now if we could have a page with new and old on at the same time I could work out what the actual issue is</p>

<p>create a user style sheet with for example:</p>

<pre><code>tr.comment&gt;td {

    font: 16px Lucida Sans !important; 

}
</code></pre>

<p>---------- Or</p>

<pre><code>tr.comment&gt;td {

    font: 15px Helvetica !important; 

}
</code></pre>

<p>Save the file ( plain text) it as  stackComments.css</p>

<p>And then in the Safari preferences -> Advanced: </p>

<p>Use the <strong>style sheet</strong> drop down option 'other' to navigate and select your style sheet.</p>

<p>This should change the font size and font to whatever you set it to.</p>

			<div id = "comment-4459" class = "comment">
				<p>@Jin   It's not browser cached, but it may be the CDN (not quite an expert on that). The last modified header is from Friday March 6 but it still gives me the old image. I also tried from 2 different internet connections, neither works.</p>

<p>Couple of weeks go by &amp; now all the other SE sites actually look a bit fat &amp; bold by comparison.</p>

				<p><p>Jin - please see if the line spacing can be harmonized on this post (and those like it). I think the edit icon introduced a gap in the last line.</p>
