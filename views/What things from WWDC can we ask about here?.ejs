	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>With the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/schedule/#/" rel="nofollow">annual developer conference WWDC</a> starting today for 2016 - Apple is announcing new things. </p>

<p>Where can we ask / talk / learn more about the live stream of WWDC 2016 on Ask Different?</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>Anything that isn't covered by the NDA, that's public knowledge, can be asked about on Ask Different.</p>

<p><a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/38/ask-different-chat">Ask Different Chat</a> is available for things that don't work as practical questions. Chat is also the best place to discuss the live stream since that part of community doesn't work well as practical Q/A on the main site.</p>


<p>However is it worth answering anything here. In general we don't know at it is liable to change. </p>

<p>It would be much easier to simply say we don't know and close it.</p>

<p>e.g this <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/242601/cannot-use-icloud-photo-library-wrong-disk-format">question</a> and we get comments that are based on partial information</p>

<p>It is just wasting time to read let alone answer.</p>

<p>Also in a beta expect to have to reformat your disk. If you have to ask how to get data back you should not run a beta. So really any more questions on this is lack of research which is a reason to down vote</p>
