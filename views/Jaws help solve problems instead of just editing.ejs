				<p><p>Welcome to Stack Exchange and Ask Different.</p>

<p>We are community edited and community supported, so some people will edit questions that need help or that they think need help.</p>

<p>Your best bet is to edit your question after reading the [about] and [help] sections for the main site. Providing details on what specifically you tried, researching an Apple support article or a post on the internet and explaining precisely what you are struggling with while following those instructions is the best way to attract a good answer to your post.</p>
