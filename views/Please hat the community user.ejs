				<h2>Please hat the community user</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/-1/community">community user</a> is showing up in the Ask Different <a href="http://winterba.sh/leaderboard" rel="nofollow noreferrer">winter bash leaderboard</a>.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the community process is working hard, but until now there was no easy way to measure its contribution.</p>

<p>It has earned hats, and we should allow it to wear one.</p>

<p>Please request that Stack Exchange select a hat for the community user to proudly wear, demonstrating its contribution and commitment to a better Ask Different!</p>

				<p>I intend to exercise the ability of moderators to issue hats to the community user. The festivities will commence once the proper code is issued to the web engines.</p>
