				<h2>How do I ask a user a question?</h2>
<p>I would like to ask monomeeth if he ever got a solution to his <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/257175/how-do-i-make-the-users-library-folder-within-a-time-machine-backup-available/257932#257932">question</a>?</p>

<p>How can I do this?</p>

<p>Also, why did I have to wait 40 mins before I could post this question?!?! </p>

<p>Stack Exchange has no private messaging system for this purpose.</p>

<p>You had to wait a bit to ask a second question because of the rate limiting in use on every function on the site. As your reputation increases, the rate limits increase but never completely disappear (although they do increase so much that you won't really run into them).</p>
