<p>It seems to be a basic StackExchange feature that I just can't understand.  I feel I am being bone-headed in some way.  I have looked through the help, and tried clicking everyting I can find in the browser.  </p>

<p>I don't know what they are called, and I wonder how they are made.</p>

				<p><p>The answer is more hidden than it should be. You aren't being bone-headed.</p>

<p>They're called comments. Once you earn <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/privileges/comment">50 reputation points</a> you gain the ability to write them.</p>

<p>You can't find the link to do it yet because you haven't accumulated sufficient reputation points on this site, but once you do, you'll find them much less confusing!</p>

				<p>@505 As you can see here, when you ask a question, you can comment so when you ask a good question like this on e main site, you can comment there and also will likely get some votes and reputation from up votes.</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-3264" class = "post">
				<p>You can always comment on your own question or answers, no matter your reputation. The limit only prevents you from commenting on other questions/answers.</p>
