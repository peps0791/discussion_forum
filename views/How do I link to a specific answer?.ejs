				<h2>How do I link to a specific answer?</h2>
<p>I've seen people make a link to a specific answer here, but now that I want to do this, I can't find any documentation or even an example to copy...  How do I form the URL to a specific answer?</p>

<p>This link has your user number embedded in it - so since I clicked the share, my number of 9058 is embedded. You can omit that part if you don't want "credit" for the share (yes there is a badge for that and on occasion contests).</p>

<p>Under the hood, each post (a question or an answer has a unique post number) so you can also tack the post number on the end of the question's URL which is more readably available.</p>
