	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>I've occasionally stumbled into Q&amp;A's that have more than 1 answer and an accepted answer, but the accepted answer isn't on top of the answer list.</p>

<p>Is this a feature or a bug?</p>

<p><strong>Yes, I have answers sorted by "active"</strong>. But usually accepted answer overrides it; for example, these list the answers with accepted on top:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/20085/does-the-oleophobic-effect-of-the-iphone-screen-wear-off-over-time">Does the oleophobic effect of the iPhone screen wear off over time?</a></li>

</ul>
