				<h2>Legality of discussions</h2>
<p>How is it acceptable to discuss methods of taking over others' devices? Came here looking for help with security and I see inquiries almost all pertaining to taking control over products, aka stealing/theft. </p>

				<p>I've moved this to our Meta site as it is more about what is ok/not ok to ask/answer than about a specific problem. Can you maybe add a link or two to questions which you consider problematic so we have the same things in mind when discussing this?</p>

				<p><p>You can discuss a lot of things that are illegal without falling afoul of the law. Imagine if you couldn't discuss murder? It'd be really hard to study case law or report the news.</p>

<p>There's also varying laws around the world when it comes to actions. So some action that might be illegal in one country could be perfectly legal in another.</p>

<p>Knowledge isn't illegal to possess or to share.</p>

				<p>Perhaps instead of law I should've used moral compass and empathy, but keep doin u</p>

				<p>Because discussing murder is equivalent to instructing others on how to compromise other people's possessions.</p>

				<p>ermmm...1) no it isn't & 2) without examples all we can keep saying is 1) no it isn't.</p>

				<p>Discussing how someone was murdered certainly is @ShuddaBeenCodin and that isn't illegal. Knowledge, possessed or given, is not illegal.</p>
