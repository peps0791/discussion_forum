				<h2>Legality of discussions</h2>
<p>How is it acceptable to discuss methods of taking over others' devices? Came here looking for help with security and I see inquiries almost all pertaining to taking control over products, aka stealing/theft. </p>

				<p>I've moved this to our Meta site as it is more about what is ok/not ok to ask/answer than about a specific problem. Can you maybe add a link or two to questions which you consider problematic so we have the same things in mind when discussing this?</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-6354" class = "post">
				<p>Examples! Examples, please!</p>

			<div id = "comment-6355" class = "post">
				<p>What exactly are you talking about?  I don't see anything like that here.</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-6358" class = "post">
				<p>If you provide some, any, example of stealing or theft, please post them here for us to review.  I'm here fairly regularly and I don't recall seeing anything similar to what you've described.</p>

				<p><p>You can discuss a lot of things that are illegal without falling afoul of the law. Imagine if you couldn't discuss murder? It'd be really hard to study case law or report the news.</p>

<p>There's also varying laws around the world when it comes to actions. So some action that might be illegal in one country could be perfectly legal in another.</p>

<p>Knowledge isn't illegal to possess or to share.</p>

				<p>Perhaps instead of law I should've used moral compass and empathy, but keep doin u</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-6357" class = "post">
				<p>Because discussing murder is equivalent to instructing others on how to compromise other people's possessions.</p>

				<p>ermmm...1) no it isn't & 2) without examples all we can keep saying is 1) no it isn't.</p>

				<p>Discussing how someone was murdered certainly is @ShuddaBeenCodin and that isn't illegal. Knowledge, possessed or given, is not illegal.</p>
