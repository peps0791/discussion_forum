	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>On Stack Overflow, a version tag (e.g. "c#-4.0") is used when the question is about a feature specific for that version.<br>
Is the same true for the OS tags used on <em>Ask Different</em>, or should I use the OS tags only to report the OS I am using?</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>Our version-specific OS tags use the 'big cat' name of the OS release.</p>

<pre><code>10.4 -&gt; tiger  
10.5 -&gt; leopard  
10.6 -&gt; snow-leopard  
10.7 -&gt; lion
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Use one of these when you have a question that's OS-specific.<br>
When your question is not OS-specific, use the generic <code>osx</code> tag.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tags should not be used just to tell us what version of the OS you're using; add that to the question itself.</strong></p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p><em>"How can I rename Desktops in Lion?"</em><br>
Desktops (Spaces) changed a lot in Lion; this is a very Lion-specific question.<br>
[lion]</p>

<p><em>"Error when connecting to my Mac with SSH"</em><br>
This is a general troubleshooting question. While it may be useful to know the OS, it isn't a question specifically about that OS.<br>
[osx], version info in the question.</p>
