<p>My answer receives a downvote (also if I don't understand why) and 1 upvote. As a result a earned 9 points. That's ok.</p>

<p>However when I look at the answer it has 1 point. How can it be possible, shouldn't it be 0? </p>

		<p>As far as I can tell, if there was a downvote, it has been uncast, so that there is no downvote on the question now:</p>
