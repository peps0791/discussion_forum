				<h2>Should FAQ#dontask explain "too localized"</h2>
<p>While questions can be reported/closed for being too localized, the FAQ only seems to address overly broad scopes, and not too localized ones.</p>

<p>Should the FAQ be updated to explain these guidelines?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Common reasons a question may be closed include </p>
  
  <p>too localized This question is unlikely to help any future visitors;
  it is only relevant to a small geographic area, a specific moment in
  time, or an extraordinarily narrow situation that is not generally
  applicable to the worldwide audience of the internet.</p>
