				<h2>Question Deletion</h2>
<p>I'm not sure if it contributes to our site stats, but one possible way to increase our answer / question ratio would be to delete some of the closed questions that have no useful answers.  Even if it doesn't help the ratio it would be nice for overall site cohesiveness.  </p>

<p>I've cast some delete votes and I hope that my fellow mod-tool priviligees will follow suit :)</p>

<h3>from the FAQ:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>When should I delete questions?</p>
  
  <p>Closed questions that are of no
  lasting value whatsoever should be
  flagged and deleted.</p>
  
  <p>(Before voting to delete, please check
  that there are no good answers -- if
  so, then the question should be
  flagged for moderator attention as a
  potential merge candidate. We don't
  like to lose great answers!)</p>

				<p>Here's a search of all closed questions with no answers that are potentially dragging our ratio down:</p>

<p><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=answers%3A0+closed%3A1">https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=answers%3A0+closed%3A1</a></p>

<p>Not all of these should be deleted, of course, but it's a good place to start.</p>
