				<h2>Layout should use overflow-y: scroll to prevent flickering</h2>
<p>It's  the first time I've noticed this on a SE site but I guess it applies not only to Apple.SE. </p>

<p>On pages where the contents load relatively slowly (e.g. sometimes,  <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/users">the "Users" page</a>) there is a noticeable Flash of when the page is built, and at some point gets a vertical scroll bar. The page's contents move 16px to the left once the scroll bar is added.</p>

<p>It's a minor thing, but noticeable. I would consider using <code>overflow-y: auto</code> in order to force a scroll bar, whether there is need for one or not. It would make for a smoother browsing experience.</p>

<p>Bumping this, as it still happens.</p>

				<p>Funnily enough, this *might* be a Windows-only problem - I can't for the life of me remember how OS X displays scroll bars. It should be fixed anyway IMO.</p>

				<p>@Lo c No. I see the flicker only in Chrome 10. IE shows a disabled scroll bar by default; FF removes the scrollbar when it doesn't need it, but does that more smoothly.</p>
