				<h2>Can't answer a protected question despite having sufficient reputation</h2>
<p>The question <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/127840/apple-a1277-usb-ethernet-adapter-not-working-on-macbook-air">Apple A1277 USB ethernet adapter not working on MacBook Air</a> requires a reputation of 10 to post an answer. My account has a reputation of 106, through (mostly) the magic cross-site Stack Exchange bonus, but I can't post an answer.</p>

<p>Any ideas why?</p>

				<p><p>Protected questions require 10 reputation to have been <strong>earned on the site itself</strong>, thus this is <a href="/questions/tagged/status-bydesign" class="post-tag moderator-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;status-bydesign&#39;" rel="tag">status-bydesign</a>.</p>

<p>The 100 reputation association bonus is purposefully removed from the calculation used to determine if you have sufficient reputation to answer a protected question, and as such you have 6 reputation which is below the 10 threshold.</p>

<p>If you found the protected question notice confusing, feel free to upvote this Meta.SE feature request to <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/210481/improve-protected-question-message-with-regard-to-rep-gained-through-associati">change the phrasing of the protected question post notice</a>.</p>

<p>I went to upvote your question so you'd have enough reputation, but I've already done that!</p>
