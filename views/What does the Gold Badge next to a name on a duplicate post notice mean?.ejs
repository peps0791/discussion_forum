				<h2>What does the Gold Badge next to a name on a duplicate post notice mean?</h2>
<p>Recently, I found this when I was editing:

What does the gold circle in the shape of a badge mean? Gold Badges don't appear on all marked as duplicate post notices.</p>

				<p>It is a tag badge. There is a silver, gold and bronze tag badge. You get one for each tag depending on the score you earn on each. For example. a gold osx badge shows this gold badge symbol when marking as duplicate. It gives the user elevated privileges to better handle tag moderation.</p>
