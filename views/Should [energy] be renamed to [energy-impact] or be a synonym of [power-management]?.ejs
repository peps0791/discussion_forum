It is used on a variety of questions, mostly in unison with <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/power-management" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;power-management&#39;" rel="tag">power-management</a> for general energy questions, or when talking about the Energy Impact.</p>

<p>Is <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/energy" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;energy&#39;" rel="tag">energy</a> supposed to be referring to the Energy Impact? The tag has no wiki or excerpt. If so, could the tag be renamed to <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/energy-impact" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;energy-impact&#39;" rel="tag">energy-impact</a> to make that clear? If not, could it be a synonym of <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/power-management" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;power-management&#39;" rel="tag">power-management</a>?</p>
