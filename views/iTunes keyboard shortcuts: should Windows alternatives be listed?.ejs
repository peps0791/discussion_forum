				<h2>iTunes keyboard shortcuts: should Windows alternatives be listed?</h2>
<p>I often give keyboard shortcuts in my answers. Usually, this is for Mac software, so I can just say "Use <kbd>  (cmd)</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd> to select all," but when I'm giving instructions for iTunes shortcuts, I have no way of knowing the OS the asker is running unless they explicitly state it. When they don't, what should I use? "  (cmd, or ctrl if you're running Windows)"?</p>

<p>(Also, please don't tell me to just give the menu path. I usually give shortcuts in conjunction with those.)</p>

				<p><p>I think it's OK to assume the asker is using Mac OS unless they explicitly specify otherwise in the title, body, or tags of their question (best to check all 3).</p>

				<p>Perhaps we could add something to the FAQ about that -- "Questions about Apple software running on Microsoft Windows are on topic, but please specify that in your question, as answerers here are otherwise apt to assume you are using a Mac."</p>

				<p>@Daniel unfortunately we can only edit the top section of the FAQ ("what kinds of questions can I ask here?"). maybe tag wiki edits world work?</p>

				<p><p>I would just use the Apple shortcuts.  The assumption if nothing is stated has to be that the user is on a Mac.  Doing a tag search yields the following stats for results this year to date:</p>

<p>[itunes] [windows] - 2 hits</p>

<p>[itunes] [os x] - 2 hits</p>

<p>[itunes] [mac] - 4 hits</p>

<p>[itunes] - 100+ hits</p>

<p>So by some very basic maths (with the obvious problem that some of the [itunes] only search results were also for [ios]/[ipad]/[iphone]/[ipod] etc etc where shortcuts are not appropriate anyway) would suggest less than 2% of questions explicitly state Windows.</p>

				<p>Thanks, though on questions that *do* state "windows", it isn't really an issue. It's only on the ones that don't say either way that it comes up.</p>
