	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>I often give keyboard shortcuts in my answers. Usually, this is for Mac software, so I can just say "Use <kbd>  (cmd)</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd> to select all," but when I'm giving instructions for iTunes shortcuts, I have no way of knowing the OS the asker is running unless they explicitly state it. When they don't, what should I use? "  (cmd, or ctrl if you're running Windows)"?</p>

<p>(Also, please don't tell me to just give the menu path. I usually give shortcuts in conjunction with those.)</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>I think it's OK to assume the asker is using Mac OS unless they explicitly specify otherwise in the title, body, or tags of their question (best to check all 3).</p>


<p>I would just use the Apple shortcuts.  The assumption if nothing is stated has to be that the user is on a Mac.  Doing a tag search yields the following stats for results this year to date:</p>

<p>[itunes] [windows] - 2 hits</p>

<p>[itunes] [os x] - 2 hits</p>

<p>[itunes] [mac] - 4 hits</p>

<p>[itunes] - 100+ hits</p>

<p>So by some very basic maths (with the obvious problem that some of the [itunes] only search results were also for [ios]/[ipad]/[iphone]/[ipod] etc etc where shortcuts are not appropriate anyway) would suggest less than 2% of questions explicitly state Windows.</p>
