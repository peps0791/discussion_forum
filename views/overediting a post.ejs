				<h2>overediting a post</h2>
<p>What should we do if somebody over-edits our post?</p>

<p>e.g, my original post was not perfect, and I appreciate some of what was added, but the edit changed my position on the subject, made the question "not a question" and left my name attached to the post:</p>

<p><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/60958/help-me-understand-the-shadow-files-for-every-mac-file-that-gets-sent-to-a-li">Will setting a cron job to delete ._ shadow files on a linux share work?</a></p>

<p>Can I see my original post to compare?  Is there a "revert" or something?</p>

				<p><p>Roll it back and add a comment as to why you prefer your wording or better, make a second edit to keep the good and further refine things you feel could be made better. </p>

<p>In your specific case, I edited it quite severely since it was a rant and they get flagged and closed more often than not, but as the author of the post you generally get extra leeway in how a post reads. Who cares if people are livid - the emotional state of others on a chat board or even one person's frustration rarely add value to a question on the site so we do edit out rants as a point of policy. I did leave in the "livid" part to indicate that you were frustrated and chose those words to characterize this function and your view of it.</p>

<p>Since the site is <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/faq#editing">edited collaboratively</a> - you should expect a back and forth as well as be open to what the regulars consider "good form" when you are new to a particular site.</p>

<p>Just click on the edited... link to see revisions and comments as to why a particular edit was made...</p>

<p>Do let the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/faq#editing">faq</a> soak in on the part about being comfortable with others editing your words.</p>

				<p>I won't revert, I know it was done in the right spirit...  which is why I ask.  I was surprised at the heavy edit.  Note that the edit contains an *answer* to my question... "should I set up a cron job?", but I'm still not sure if that *was* the right thing to do in this case.  I'm not new to Stackexchange, only new to the Apple forum.  I haven't seen this kind of edit before.</p>

				<p>I'm glad you're here and also glad for the content. It was on the heavy end of edits for sure but we get hundreds of "apple sucks - why did they do this stupid thing" and I honestly didn't want your name colored into that category. It's a great question. I did take a second edit at your title - I hope the last edit captures your main intent better.</p>
