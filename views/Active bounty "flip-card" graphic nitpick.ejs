<p>Don't mean to be overly critical / nitpicky....  but every time I see this graphic..</p>

<p>my <em>not-horribly-or-excessively OCD</em>, yet <em>atmittedly design-concious</em> brain has to stop, look, and do a double-take at this rendering.  Its missing the gap between the "cards", <em>or something</em>..  It would look "more real", maybe, like this quick pixel-hack..</p>

				<p>Your point is taken! I completely agree with your assessment. I think this is a change that should be made (and can certainly be, very easily). Keep an eye out for it.</p>
