				<h2>Should we allow recommendations of hardware or software?</h2>
<p><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/19873/what-good-waterproof-ipad-2-cases-are-available">So I just got a can of polite and friendly moderation whupass handed to me</a> on this issue (not realising it was one), and think it may be something which we should change.</p>

<p>I <em>am</em> new, and please don't take this is me complaining about "why my question was closed" (because I hope there's a sensible explanation for this rule). It's just that, well, I don't think I'm the only one who's tried to pull this one before.</p>

<p>The rule to which I am referring is thus in the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/faq">FAQ</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOT: a shopping or buying recommendation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From first principles I'd argue this rule seriously hinders the ability to help others: when someone comes to ask for help, and the best solution is a third party tool, <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/19859/disk-space-disappeared-what-happened/19875#19875">shouldn't we recommend it?</a> Any time we come with a question, aren't we indirectly asking for recommendations of other products, if they exist and can help us? By virtue of the question we do not know if they exist.</p>

<p>A hypothetical user asking about some unusual messages from diskutil might be pointed in the direction of <a href="http://www.alsoft.com/diskwarrior/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">DiskWarrior</a>: is that wrong?</p>

<p>Consider also that in other places on meta we seem to have tacitly <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/58/tag-for-alternatives-to-windows-only-applications">accepted</a> <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/375/are-non-apple-mac-os-x-ios-software-questions-on-topic-is-the-faq-outdated">recommendations</a>. There is even a <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/software-recommendation">software recommendation</a> tag!</p>

<p>Now, I find it highly specious that only software may be recommended, but not hardware. There just seems to be few good reasons for doing so. Likewise if a shopping or buying recommendation is not allowed due to the transaction of money, that would be the worst kind of free software fandom.</p>

<p>At the very least I must be badly misunderstanding the rules, so it would be wonderful if someone could enlighten me. But if this is a genuine inconsistency, per my arguments above, I think we should change the FAQ to <em>remove</em> the quoted rule.</p>

  <p>Thus, when it comes to shopping questions, don t ask us what you should buy   <strong>ask us what you need to <em>learn</em> to tell what you should buy.</strong></p>
