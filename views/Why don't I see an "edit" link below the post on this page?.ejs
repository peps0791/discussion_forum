<p>This question:
<a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/36760/cant-authorise-computer-to-play-itunes-songs">Can&#39;t authorize computer to play iTunes songs</a></p>

<p>could use some editing, but I don't see an "edit" link below the question as I see on other questions.</p>

<p>I tried editing the URL to match the URL I see when editing an article (<a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/36760/edit">https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/36760/edit</a>) but I get a "Page Not Found" error for that URL.</p>

<p>What happened with this question? Is it a website error, or am I not allowed to edit it for some reason?</p>
