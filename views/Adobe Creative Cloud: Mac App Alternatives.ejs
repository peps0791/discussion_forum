	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>I recently asked a question <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/90768/adobe-creative-cloud-mac-app-alternatives">here</a> regarding Adobe Creative Cloud: Mac App Alternatives which according to @bmike has been temporarily closed. In hindsight should have asked here first, but sometimes I get too excited.</p>

<p>Its probably a good idea for an Ask Different Blog Post instead. Can we work out an outline or at least gauge interest in a blog post here?</p>

		<p>See here <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1676/whats-wrong-with-a-question-asking-for-alternatives-to-adobe-cs-in-the-cloud">What&#39;s wrong with a question asking for alternatives to Adobe CS in the cloud?</a></p>

<p>Again, I want to thank you so much for asking it and being excited about the site and about generating good relevant content. </p>

<p>We can use this question to work on some blog post outlines and the other question to hash out what to do with the original question.</p>
