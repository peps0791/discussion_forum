				<h2>Adobe Creative Cloud: Mac App Alternatives</h2>
<p>I recently asked a question <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/90768/adobe-creative-cloud-mac-app-alternatives">here</a> regarding Adobe Creative Cloud: Mac App Alternatives which according to @bmike has been temporarily closed. In hindsight should have asked here first, but sometimes I get too excited.</p>

<p>Its probably a good idea for an Ask Different Blog Post instead. Can we work out an outline or at least gauge interest in a blog post here?</p>

				<p><p>See here <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1676/whats-wrong-with-a-question-asking-for-alternatives-to-adobe-cs-in-the-cloud">What&#39;s wrong with a question asking for alternatives to Adobe CS in the cloud?</a></p>

<p>Again, I want to thank you so much for asking it and being excited about the site and about generating good relevant content. </p>

<p>We can use this question to work on some blog post outlines and the other question to hash out what to do with the original question.</p>

				<p>Ok thanks very much</p>

			<div id = "comment-3142" class = "comment">
				<p>This comment should go here rather than on the other question: Obviously good alternatives exist IMHO eg Pixelmator in place of Photoshop, iDraw instead of illustrator, Camtasia instead of Premiere etc etc. If there is a way to collate them</p>

			<div id = "comment-3143" class = "comment">
				<p>@simon Yes - we have tags on the main site, so for starters look at the questions that are tagged both [tag:adobe] and [tag:software-recommendation]</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-3144" class = "comment">
				<p>Yes that right, in terms of CS in the cloud this is the first one</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-3145" class = "comment">
				<p>Still no reponses to the other question...strange</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-3147" class = "comment">
				<p>I'd give it time - if after 3 or 4 days, no one wants to discuss it (or better, makes an edit to the question to kick it to the re-open queue) them perhaps we'll know if people don't have an opinion and/or are OK with it being closed.</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-3150" class = "comment">
				<p>Ok fine, lets wait.</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-3151" class = "comment">
				<p>You certainly don't have to wait - you can answer that other question to get the ball rolling on explaining why it should be reopened unless you now agree that it's not a good fit...</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-3152" class = "comment">
				<p>Ok fine, i'll do it tomorrow. I find it strange that no one makes a comment, even if its a negative one. I guess they must have the money to spend.</p>
