		</title>

	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>Does anyone else think that the FAQ should include addressing statements of one or <em>both</em>:</p>

<ol>
<li>jailbreaking (still legal in USA)</li>
<li>unlocking (ruled illegal under some circumstances in the USA)</li>
</ol>

<p>1-For jail-breaking the tendency on meta and main site is that it's okay. As such, I think it should be added to the FAQ. Where I went quickly to check. Sure, you can search for whatever you want, but the FAQ is supposed to be a thorough resource as far as I understand it.</p>

<p>2-<a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/213144/unlocking-a-new-iphone-is-now-illegal-but-jailbreaking-is-still-safe-what-it-all-means-for-you/" rel="nofollow">article at cult of mac here with details re: unlocking</a></p>

<p>Basically, according to the article, if your phone was bought after January 26th 2013, you can't use a 'third party' to unlock it, you must use your current carrier.</p>

<p>As far as I know that ruling has not been changed.</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>Legal constraints around jailbreaking/unlocking are different around the globe, so we either allow all or nothing. Personally I would go with the "allow all" option unless there is a strong legal reason that StackExchange Inc will get in trouble that way. </p>

<p>The biggest issue we have with the "unlock" questions is actually the removal of spam answers they seem to attract...</p>
