				<h2>Update FAQ to include Jail-breaking and~or unlocking</h2>
<p>Does anyone else think that the FAQ should include addressing statements of one or <em>both</em>:</p>

<ol>
<li>jailbreaking (still legal in USA)</li>
<li>unlocking (ruled illegal under some circumstances in the USA)</li>
</ol>

<p>1-For jail-breaking the tendency on meta and main site is that it's okay. As such, I think it should be added to the FAQ. Where I went quickly to check. Sure, you can search for whatever you want, but the FAQ is supposed to be a thorough resource as far as I understand it.</p>

<p>Basically, according to the article, if your phone was bought after January 26th 2013, you can't use a 'third party' to unlock it, you must use your current carrier.</p>

<p>As far as I know that ruling has not been changed.</p>

				<p>Legal constraints around jailbreaking/unlocking are different around the globe, so we either allow all or nothing. Personally I would go with the "allow all" option unless there is a strong legal reason that StackExchange Inc will get in trouble that way. </p>

<p>The biggest issue we have with the "unlock" questions is actually the removal of spam answers they seem to attract...</p>
