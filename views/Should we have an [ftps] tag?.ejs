	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>Instead of doing sftp, we can go to Finder and connect to server using <code>ftps://somesite.com</code>.  So <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ftps" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;ftps&#39;" rel="tag">ftps</a> should be a valid tag if the user is inquiring about it.</p>

<p>The question is at: <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/278627/after-connecting-to-a-server-using-ftps-somesite-com-the-files-cannot-be-dragg">After connecting to a server using ftps://somesite.com the files cannot be dragged and dropped there?</a></p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>I don't think we need a specific <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ftps" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;ftps&#39;" rel="tag">ftps</a> tag right now. The question you linked just happens to be using FTPS, rather than being about FTPS. There's no questions I can find which are specific to the secure version of FTP   only about FTP in general. The standard tag of <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ftp" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;ftp&#39;" rel="tag">ftp</a> will suffice.</p>
