				<h2>Protected questions not considering +100 bonus rep for linking profile</h2>
<p>I have over 22k rep on various SE sites (mainly EE.SE) and received the 100 rep bonus when I came here for the first time and signed in.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aYY8l.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>However, I was prevented from answering a <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/151480/music-files-dont-copy-from-itunes-to-iphone-appear-grey-with-a-dotted-circle?s=2%7C0.9009">protected question</a> because of insufficient reputation.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aeUOz.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>What gives? Since when is 101 less than 10? Is this a bug or by design? If it <em>is</em> by design, admins should update the protection note to clearly say that rep earned elsewhere doesn't count against the restriction.</p>

<p>Tried with two different browsers - same deal.</p>

The association bonus is purposefully removed from the calculation used to determine if you have sufficient reputation to answer a protected question.</p>

<p>To answer a protected question, you must earn 10 reputation specifically on this site, regardless of your reputation elsewhere on Stack Exchange.</p>

<p>There's already a feature request on Meta.SE to <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/210481/improve-protected-question-message-with-regard-to-rep-gained-through-associati">change the phrasing of the protected question post notice</a>.</p>
