				<h2>Why do silent changes made by  Community   show up in the front page?</h2>
<p>I have often seen, on the front page, a question from years ago showing up as  Active  due to an update made by  Community  . Specifically, <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/94156/iphone-3gs-turning-off-randomly-while-being-used/?lastactivity">this question</a> does not show any activity with <code>?lastactivity</code> (accessible from the front page by clicking the link that looks like  24m ago ).</p>

<p>The revision histories of <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/75005/revisions">the question</a> and <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/75006/revisions">both</a> <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/83937/revisions">answers</a> show nothing indicating an edit.</p>

<p>I don't know why it shows up in the  Active  section if the changes made are silent.</p>

				<p><p>Questions with no or no upvoted answers (as the one referenced in the question) will get reinfected into the front page a few times automatically to get more attention. As no user is involved the user is shown as "community". </p>

<p>Like many users, community has a profile page that explains what they like to do on the site. In this case, community is a robot that randomly pokes these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/-1/community">https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/-1/community</a></li>

				<p>@grgarside Whether it shows "Community" or the actual user of the deleted post depends on your reputation. If you are allowed to see deleted posts (>10k) you see the user. Otherwise you see "Community".</p>

				<p>Was this a recent change? On other sites where I have <10k I think I still see the user for deleted content   feel free to rollback though :)</p>

				<p>I am far below 10K and see the actual user when answers are deleted. It is occasionally confusing (more so when I first started noticing it)</p>
