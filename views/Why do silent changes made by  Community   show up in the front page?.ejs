	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>I have often seen, on the front page, a question from years ago showing up as  Active  due to an update made by  Community  . Specifically, <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/94156/iphone-3gs-turning-off-randomly-while-being-used/?lastactivity">this question</a> does not show any activity with <code>?lastactivity</code> (accessible from the front page by clicking the link that looks like  24m ago ).</p>

<p>The revision histories of <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/75005/revisions">the question</a> and <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/75006/revisions">both</a> <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/83937/revisions">answers</a> show nothing indicating an edit.</p>

<p>I don't know why it shows up in the  Active  section if the changes made are silent.</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>Questions with no or no upvoted answers (as the one referenced in the question) will get reinfected into the front page a few times automatically to get more attention. As no user is involved the user is shown as "community". </p>

<p>Like many users, community has a profile page that explains what they like to do on the site. In this case, community is a robot that randomly pokes these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/-1/community">https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/-1/community</a></li>
</ul>
