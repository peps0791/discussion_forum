				<h2>The bounty expiration shown in the notification message is different from the expiration shown in the question</h2>
<p>I logged in early on <em>Ask Different</em>, and I have got a message about the expiration of the bounty I offered. When I clicked on the question link, I noticed the question was reporting the bounty would expire one day earlier.</p>

				<p><p>In two days your question will cease to be promoted as a bounty question. However, you are given an extra day to select your bounty answer before one is selected automatically.</p>

				<p>If I understand correctly, the sentence in the question page says "ending in two days" because an answer given after 3 days is not eligible for the bounty, while the bounty effectively expires after 3 days, which means I cannot anymore select to which answer I give the bounty. Is it correct?</p>

				<p>@kiamlaluno from everyone else's perspective, the bounty ends in 2 days, but you have an additional day, so that's why the system was telling you that you had 3 days</p>

				<p>Ooh - that is subtle. The expiration time for me to award the bounty is different than the public promotion period. A very nice touch despite the confusion.</p>
