				<h2>Merge Quicklook and preview</h2>
<p>Quicklook seems to be the official name for the preview.app functionality.</p>

<p>Please merge them, it's displaying me it needs at least+5 score in the tag to merge.</p>

				<p><ul>
<li>Quicklook is what you get if you press <kbd>Space</kbd> in Finder to view the content of a file</li>
<li>Preview.app is an application on its own</li>
</ul>

<p>Unless I misunderstood your intention I don't think these two tags should get merged.</p>

				<p>Indeed it appears to be true... no you're right. I meant Preview was Quicklook indeed.</p>

				<p>You comment confuses me somewhat, Quicklook and Preview.app are 2 very different things, and I'm not sure if you have changed your mind, or think that Patrix agrees with you!  Can you clarify (sorry if I am being dim here)</p>
