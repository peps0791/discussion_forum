	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>Quicklook seems to be the official name for the preview.app functionality.</p>

<p>Please merge them, it's displaying me it needs at least+5 score in the tag to merge.</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<ul>
<li>Quicklook is what you get if you press <kbd>Space</kbd> in Finder to view the content of a file</li>
<li>Preview.app is an application on its own</li>
</ul>

<p>Unless I misunderstood your intention I don't think these two tags should get merged.</p>
