				<h2>Podcast #1: iPhone location tracking, Dropbox, Portal 2</h2>
<p>This is first episode of the Ask Different Podcast, an unofficial podcast about Apple and related technologies created by members of the Ask Different community.</p>

<p>Your hosts for this episode are <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/13/kyle-cronin">Kyle Cronin</a>, <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/1346/vxjasonxv">Jason Salaz</a>, and <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/2220/nathan">Nathan Greenstein</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We begin by discussing the return of the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/04/podcast-88/">Stack <strike>Overflow</strike> Exchange podcast</a>, and some of the interesting observations Joel made about where Stack Exchange users are coming from.</p></li>
<li><p>Speculation abounds as we discuss iPhone tracking and the location visualizations as provided by <a href="http://petewarden.github.com/iPhoneTracker/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">iPhone Tracker</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Jason provides tips for being safe on the web. Including using a strong Password Encryption/Storage service such as <a href="https://lastpass.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">LastPass</a>, and enabling always-use-SSL features on sites such as <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2011/03/making-twitter-more-secure-https.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=74765" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Google Mail</a>, and <a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=486790652130" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Facebook</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Nathan talks about Mac security, such as enabling <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1820" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Secure Erase</a> features, and protecting your computer at boot time by <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1352" rel="nofollow noreferrer">setting a Firmware Password</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Kyle helps keep your iOS devices safe with the free <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/find-my-iphone-setup/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"> Find My iPhone  feature</a> of MobileMe for iPhone 4 owners, and <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4113" rel="nofollow noreferrer">setting a passcode (or password)</a> on your device.</p></li>
<li><p>Speculation returns as we discuss the recent revelation that Dropbox is <a href="http://blog.dropbox.com/?p=735" rel="nofollow noreferrer">not necessarily a completely private storage service</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Our Question of the Week was asked by <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/1475/nuc">nuc</a>. <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/11859/what-are-some-great-dropbox-uses"> What are some great Dropbox uses? </a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://dropvoxapp.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Dropvox</a> is $0.99 on the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dropvox/id416288287" rel="nofollow noreferrer">iTunes App Store</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://wiki.dropbox.com/DropboxAddons/MacDropAny" rel="nofollow noreferrer">MacDropAny</a> is free.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.stepmania.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">StepMania</a> is free (and fun!), although it is not directly related to Dropbox.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Our App of the Week is <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/620/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Portal 2</a>! Portal 1 has been Mac compatible since the day Steam was released for Mac OS X, and Portal 2 has been Mac-compatible from the very beginning.</p></li>

				<p>I can't seem to get the podcast to work. It doesn't play on my iMac running OSX 10.5.8. EDIT: I can play it once I download the file locally, but not via browser play.</p>

				<p><p>For those that are still interested, we plan on getting other people on the podcast at some point. It's tough to say exactly when, as our recording and producing process still needs a lot of refinement.</p>

				<p><p>It has been brought to my attention that I mis-spoke on the free vs. paid features of LastPass. Per <a href="https://lastpass.com/features_compare.php" rel="nofollow">LastPass' own page on this subject</a>, your data is always available by logging into lastpass.com, the immediate difference appears to be that there will be ads in the management interface.</p>

<p>The premium features are primarily for features such as mobile device app access to your data, two-factor auth via their own system or a yubikey, and priority technical support.</p>

<p>The price and term length were correct. $12/year is the minimum you can buy.</p>
