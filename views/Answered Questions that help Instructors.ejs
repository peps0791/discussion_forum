</ul>

<p>Why not look over the help section and tour. Also, your votes still help the site, so be sure to vote up good posts - it doesn't give reputation directly but the system does promote posts with high anonymous positive votes when it decides how to render pages.</p>

<p>Welcome to the site and I hope you can find things to answer / ask and do real voting and building of knowledge for all about Apple products.</p>
