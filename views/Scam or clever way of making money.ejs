	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>I am sure you are aware of this web site that pops up in Google search using the Titles from the Ask Different.</p>

<p><a href="http://help.howproblemsolution.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://help.howproblemsolution.com/</a></p>

<p>All it does is it shows the copy of the Title or the question, but not the answers.</p>

<p>It is loaded with adds ect..</p>

<p>Just wondering is someone has found a great way to get high web site hits and make lots of money that way?</p>

<p>Maybe it is my Google search but the Tile is definitely the same the time of post is with in a hour and sometimes even the body text is almost the same.</p>

<p>Here are few examples:</p>
