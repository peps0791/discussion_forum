	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>I asked a question on AskDifferent and someone replied to it by deleting it. I got 2 notifications that my question has been answered but now that I've logged in to the site, I cannot see those comments as the question has been deleted.</p>

<p>How am I supposed to even know the reason of the deletion if I cannot view the comments, find out who deleted by question or look at the question?</p>

<p>It's sad that someone just deleted the question without me even being able to look at the reasons why my question was wrong.</p>

<p>Can someone tell me how to see those comments??</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>I deleted your question. You left the access keys to a website in the code. They were deleted, but that simply moves the keys into the history, they don't get completely removed. Since there is no way for me delete a specific version of a question entirely, the entire question got deleted.</p>

<p>You may repost the question but without the access keys. Next time please take time to sanitize your code before posting it.</p>
