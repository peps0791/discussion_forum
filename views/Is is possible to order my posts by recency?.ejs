				<h2>Is is possible to order my posts by recency?</h2>
<p>I have quite a few posts, but my problem is that the oldest posts show first. Can I order my posts so the newest ones show up first? Or is that not possible? If it isn't possible, can this be added?</p>

				<p>I read the title as "Is it possible to order my posts by regency?" and I was wondering what the regency of a post could be.</p>

			<div id = "comment-1420" class = "comment">
				<p>@kiam It would be ordering your posts by "The office or period of government by a regent." :-)</p>

				<p>I did a bit of a double-take at first also, but then I thought: "recency   what a terrific word". A new one on me, but one to note (even if it doesn't seem to be in the dictionary   it should be, though).</p>

				<p><p>You should see buttons that let you do this.<br>
Try clicking <code>recent</code>.</p>

				<p>It should persist. Setting it once will make it automatically use that the next time.</p>

				<p>Thanks! It stays ordered by recency.</p>
