				<h2>Update: It's iPhone 4S week!</h2>
<p>This week, we re kicking off a  Hot Topic of the Week  series.</p>

<p>How it works: One topic is designated each week, and each person who asks a question relating to that topic will be eligible to win a prize. Topics are chosen from your suggestions in the community wiki below.</p>

<p>How to enter: Ask a question relating to the topic of the week, and tag it accordingly (this week, use the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/iphone-4s" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;iphone-4s&#39;" rel="tag">iphone-4s</a> tag). Each question you ask will get you one entry into a random drawing to win an iPhone accessory(s) of your choice ($100 max).</p>

<p>This round will begin today (Dec. 23) and end on Monday (Jan. 2).</p>

<p>Update: <em>Congratulations to <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/15559/allen-chao">Allen Chao</a> for <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/34708/is-my-iphone-model-number-mc922ll-a-unlocked-or-locked">winning this week</a>! Thank you everyone who participated.</em> The weekly hot topic challenge is on hold for the next week. 
Please continue to add suggestions for upcoming weeks below!</p>

				<p><p>This sounds like a great idea!</p>

<p>The model would fit perfectly for our site, especially given the wealth of apps and accessories that would make perfect prizes.</p>

<p>I saw what happened on Andorid and was secretly hoping that you guys would offer to do something similar with us :)</p>

<p>I'm posting a separate CW answer for topic ideas.</p>

				<p>Added some tags for the contest ideas. Wasn't sure about  those I left open, hopefully someone will tag them too. I think it's good to add tags for the topics already while suggesting: if the hot week topic can't be properly tagged, how could it be a good topic anyway? (And of course it is more practical for the contest manager to have the tags in advance.)</p>
