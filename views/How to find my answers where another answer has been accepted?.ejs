				<h2>How to find my answers where another answer has been accepted?</h2>
<p>I am trying to do some cleaning.</p>

<p>Is there a way to find out in my answers' history (1500), if there is a another answer to the same post that has been accepted?</p>

<p>Here is example of why:</p>

<p>That being said, the SEDE (Stack Exchange Data Explorer) is the place to go if you want assistance in crafting such a query so you can study your acceptance rate and your scoring / ability to get the "check" which are all excellent and fine goals to have.</p>
