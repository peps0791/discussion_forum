				<h2>2012 Moderator Election - Town Hall Chat Digest</h2>
<p>The following is a "digest" version of the <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1036/2012-moderator-election-town-hall-chat-wed-8-feb-0300-utc-tue-7-feb-10pm-e">2012 Moderator Election Town Hall Chat</a>. The format, <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/77831/how-can-we-improve-the-town-hall-digests">as described on Meta Stack Overflow</a>, is one <em>answer</em> to this question <em>for every question</em> asked in the Town Hall, containing all the candidate's answers to that question.</p>

<p><strong>To view the digest chronologically, please sort the answers by "oldest"</strong>.</p>

<p>If you have questions or comments about this, <strong>please do not answer this question</strong> as the answers are designed to be used for the questions from the Town hall itself. Instead, please ask on <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/77831/how-can-we-improve-the-town-hall-digests">the parent question</a> or in <a href="http://chat.meta.stackoverflow.com/rooms/352/town-hall-discussion">the Town Hall Discussion Room</a>.</p>

<p>If you see any corrections which need to be made to this digest, or if you were a candidate who was unable to attend the town hall and would like your answers included, please @Rebecca or @TimStone <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/322/ask-different-town-hall-chat">in the chat room</a> and let us know!</p>

				<p>Is it OK for us to suggest minor edits to correct typos in our responses or formatting? I don't want to change things, but noticed two small typos in my responses.</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-1963" class = "comment">
				<p>I think that's fine, yeah. I tend to notice some errors as I'm doing the digest, but we tend to avoid making unsolicited corrections to candidates' responses ourselves as a policy.</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-1966" class = "comment">
				<p>**never** in my history of creating or reading town hall digests have I seen so many downvotes. Wow.</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-1981" class = "comment">
				<p>I was wondering if that was normal in terms of the meta membership expressing opinions about the questions asked this way. I wonder if we're to interpret it as dis-satisfaction with our collective answers or more directed to the asker.</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-1982" class = "comment">
				<p>@bmike Hmm, that's a good question. I've always assumed that people were voting based on whether or not they thought that the question was something that provoked useful feedback from the candidates, but I haven't really looked at it in depth before.</p>

But I've touched on tag wikis (creating and voting), I have edited plenty of questions/answers before 2K, and have since graduated to having my edits accepted automatically, I have approved numerous edits, and used the 'review' tool at large. I've been part of plenty of question closures (though no reopens, to the best of my knowledge). And... there's more? Flagging... yep, I think I've touched every user mod tool at least once.</p>

I've used the flag tools, but relatively sparingly as I believe in allowing the OP opportunity to make changes their own way.  Without being able to see a list of flagged messages It's hard to do much more, but I have by chance come across the odd post with an edit waiting for approval which I have acted on.</p>

Sometimes no action is able to be taken on the flag, sometimes there's merely discussion in the chat room, but this is all the correct process in my opinion.</p>

But others might not flag very much because frankly, there isn't that much that needs flagging. I'm hyper-vigilant about it, and I've only managed to amass 231 flags. The mods act on them <em>very</em> quickly. So really, there isn't a lot of opportunity for most people to need to flag here. And that's a good thing about the site.</p>

It's not fair to produce a huge pile of work for the Mods when you are able to attempt to effect the change you think is required without the mod tools.  The mods have the power, but we should all share the responsibility to an extent, and I believe that a comment here and there directed at the OP suggesting improvements is often better than pointing a mod at the question...</p>

The problems I forsee are no different than most of the SE sites, or active moderation in general. Adequately managing content and users (but mostly content) in a meaningful way.</p>

I also have noticed that some of the users have very 'frantic' questions, that are hard to understand. I would hope to help convert those into actual questions, to get that user help</p>

We need more voting. We need more answering. That isn't the <em>moderator</em>'s job, per se, but it is the job of the community, and moderators play a key role in guiding the community. I'd like to see our birthday answerathon address both of these issues.</p>

My participation is particularly low except for a few 'hot button' topics that are not just confined to Ask Different. I feel that MSO needs to become Meta Stack Exchange, a true network-wide meta, and MSO should be Stack Overflow specific. Participating there helps, though not required.</p>

By having a place to ask about policy, bugs, gray areas - the main site is kept clean. A clean and focused site tends to run itself better as people don't like to throw that first piece of trash on a beautiful lawn.</p>

It builds consensus outside the main channel of information here.</p>

I do find that <em>reading</em> MSO is very helpful to understanding how the SE engine works, and would expect that a moderator on AD would have to be involved on meta.AD</p>

<p><strong><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3e1998e4b4514fc0d75eb6bd60691f0a?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG" alt="stuffe"> <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/20840/stuffe">stuffe</a> <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/3313278#3313278">answered</a>:</strong>  I think it's key, because the Meta community is by it's very nature populated with people who want more than just to ask a question and get some help.  It's filled by people who <em>want</em> to help more than ask.  The key to moderation I feel is consistency, and this means being consistent in your own actions, but also aligning your methods and approach with the other mods.</p>

<p><strong><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3e1998e4b4514fc0d75eb6bd60691f0a?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG" alt="stuffe"> <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/20840/stuffe">stuffe</a> <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/3313295#3313295">continued</a>:</strong>  The mods do not (or should not) set the tone, they gauge the tone from people in Meta, and work to make changes in a way that has community support.  I've asked and answered a number of Meta questions, some practical (CSS bugs) some hypothetical (Non bumping edits a good idea?)</p>

<p><strong><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3e1998e4b4514fc0d75eb6bd60691f0a?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG" alt="stuffe"> <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/20840/stuffe">stuffe</a> <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/3318282#3318282">concluded</a>:</strong>  My original response to this question neglected to actually, er, answer the question, as I mistook Meta AD for Meta SO.  To answer it properly, in a word, no.  I don't think there is particular relevance now in the same way as there might have been when it was more of a role model for the few new sites that came after it.  The Mod ethos spans the site, and doesn't reside in the old throne room.</p>

Talk to other moderators first. Be fair, be kind, give users the benefit of the doubt, but if there is a consensus among the moderators that someone is damaging the site and acting maliciously, use the appropriate tools (warning, account suspension, etc) to prevent the user from damaging our community</p>

<p><strong><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9bb29ef7c65ae04b3a8a98ea1c481db9?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG" alt="bmike"> <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/12928/bmike">bmike</a> <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/3311048#3311048">answered</a>:</strong>  Oh - that's easy. The automated scripts to detect pattern voting will clear most up, but they can down vote me till the cows come home. As long as they aren't defacing the site - I'd let the other mods know what's up and we all can watch it. I'd get consensus if it's better for me to handle it directly or if having another mod also comment will make the OP realize they are taking it personally.</p>

Point them to the FAQ, and/or offer a little explanation of my own. New users need explanation and encouragement. On StackOverflow, I've commented countless times "welcome, here's the FAQ. Choose a username and make yourself comfortable." It's what grows the sites - an encouraging and welcoming community.</p>

<p><strong><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3f98968b2d85fe5deaf4132bbecf9132?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG" alt="Wheat Williams"> <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/20921/wheat-williams">Wheat Williams</a> <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/3311021#3311021">answered</a>:</strong>  As a user, I have posted polite messages to a user asking them to clarify their question, to do more research and provide more background, and the like. Some are eager to do this; some just stop posting altogether, presumably going to other sites to look for answers.</p>

<p><strong><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7e4fbb2efd3b3bbedcd75a726b694ae4?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG" alt="jmlumpkin"> <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/8113/jmlumpkin">jmlumpkin</a> <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/3311044#3311044">answered</a>:</strong>  I would contact the user to see if I could help. Many of the low quality questions I have looked at before were really hard to understand due to language barriers or lack of details. If the user continues, I would usually just continue to ask for more details if they are legit questions.</p>

<p><strong><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9904b127bff836c939152dcd300ea9ea?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG" alt="Jason Salaz"> <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/798/jason-salaz">Jason Salaz</a> <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/3311054#3311054">answered</a>:</strong>  The response to this doesn't change when you're a mod. Especially considering mods are <em>not</em> judges of content. (Quality, yes, to an extent. Correctness/Content, no.) In the past, my action has been to edit if possible, comment always, and NOT "downvote and move on". This won't change.</p>

<p><strong><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a6f769d150aa072ac88620414706dd3c?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG" alt="Daniel"> <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/23007/daniel">Daniel</a> <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/3311060#3311060">answered</a>:</strong>  In my experience, comments combined with constructive edits can be very helpful. Some people learn and improve a <strong>lot</strong>. But I agree with @JasonSalaz that this isn't a <em>mod</em> issue; most of us have been doing this all along. It's a community issue.</p>

<p><strong><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9bb29ef7c65ae04b3a8a98ea1c481db9?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG" alt="bmike"> <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/12928/bmike">bmike</a> <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/3311064#3311064">answered</a>:</strong>  Again - voting and editing are good tools for minor issues. In general, it's nice to find a really awesome answer or provide that - then the low quality answers are clearly that. When they cross the line to spamming - that's when the mod tools can be used to shape or protect the site for honest attempts to participate.</p>

<p><strong><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3e1998e4b4514fc0d75eb6bd60691f0a?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG" alt="stuffe"> <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/20840/stuffe">stuffe</a> <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/3313380#3313380">answered</a>:</strong>  I see this place as a learning experience, the users are sort of in class, nor on parole, and so if need be you direct them time and time again to improve their answers, providing suggestions, or making edits and commenting on why you changed the answer.  Downvoting should be used, but as a carrot not a stick.</p>

<p><strong><img src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3e1998e4b4514fc0d75eb6bd60691f0a?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG" alt="stuffe"> <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/20840/stuffe">stuffe</a> <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/3313382#3313382">continued</a>:</strong>  If this was consistently happening, I would invite the user into chat and engage in conversation about the site, and how best they can integrate into it.  If they are doing it a lot it proves their enthusiasm to contribute, so they need encouragement to improve.</p>

I love the "Tiny Things" questions for iOS 5 and Lion, I curate the iOS 5 CW heavily, and pitch in on others. There are some that didn't/don't deserve to survive ("What would make Safari perfect" and "Terminal Tips/Tricks in Mac OS X", notably). Case-by-case basis. Quality and community (both users and mods) decision as needed.</p>

And I actually have a distinct answer. Apple is a company, an ecosystem, it's "level of skill" ranges from "learning to right click", to "programming an app" (and really, much harder). We're "softer" on some questions because it's relevant to the community. That probably shouldn't change. Ask Different is unlike almost all of the rest of Stack Exchange, scope/content-wise.</p>

				<p>Yes - I think this is good to hear criticism about the site but I wish I had put more of a clear wording on my answer - I clearly don't believe all Apple users are as a class less savvy. I think we need to be sensitive to building users up to asking great, hard questions. I'll certainly follow up with other moderators to see where this "soft" reputation is founded as this was the first I've heard of this and don't know if I agree or not with the characterization at this point.</p>

Even just today a user came in to ask if a Eudora/Rosetta Snow Leopard question was out of scope. Chat has been spirited, and more importantly, civil.</p>

Many of us have been acting as moderators for months (or years, in the case of @JasonSalaz). You don't put a diamond next to someone's name to make them a moderator. You find people who are moderating the site and give them the diamond so they have better tools to get the job done that they are already doing.</p>
