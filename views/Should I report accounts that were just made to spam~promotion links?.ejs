				<h2>Should I report accounts that were just made to spam~promotion links?</h2>
<p>I noticed today that a same link had been posted to two different questions from two different users.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/99994/yolili">Yolili</a> - posted in the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/35778/how-do-you-restore-files-from-an-icloud-backup/155599#155599">question</a></li>
<li><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/99995/babalala">babalala</a> - posted in the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/99276/having-trouble-restoring-backup-of-my-iphone/155600#155600">question</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Both those answers have search terms which the user is trying to promote for SEO. I've reported the questions, should I report the users as well?</p>

<p>This brings upon a bigger question where there are some users who've created accounts just for posting a answer with a link to a website like - <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/75960/user75960">example user</a> who posted an answer for this <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/35778/how-do-you-restore-files-from-an-icloud-backup/127837#127837">question</a>, which seems to be okay but the link is shortened which raises a flag for spam i think.</p>

<p>How should such user accounts be handled ?</p>

				<p><p>In a nutshell: Flagging the answers as spam (or just for moderator attention) is absolutely ok in these cases.</p>

<p>We look into the account when we get notified of spam messages, so there is no urgent need to flag the user as well (especially if you already flagged the answer). </p>
