				<h2>Potential Question: Does An Old Mac G5 Make A Great BBQ?</h2>
<p><strong>Was thinking about putting this as a question (if of humor) on Ask Different</strong></p>

<p>Just came across this as an alternative recycling option:</p>

<p>Is this really a viable option (if extreme) &amp; what other recycling methods exist for an old G5 ?</p>

				<p>@JasonSalaz It looks like he's put another grate over the side of it. Presumably it is a more reliable grilling surface.</p>

				<p>My guess is the case would warp severely if you put hot coals in it repeatedly. I was under the impression that the G5 / Mac Pro chassis were simply anodized aluminum which wouldn't be more or less harmful than aluminum foil or aluminum pots and pans. I'd want to see a heat sink grill pattern for maximum geek points - that round waffle pattern seems odd for grilling.</p>

				<p><p>I'd say it makes a "grate" BBQ surface but not a great one.</p>
