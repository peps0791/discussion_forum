				<h2>Why can't I suggest edits here on Meta?</h2>
<p>I've been trying to edit a post here on Meta Ask Different, but the link is just not there.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>How can I edit a post then? Why can't I do it? It works fine on the main site.</p>

				<p>This is something that the site design currently does not allow.</p>

<p><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/78223/per-site-metas-dont-have-ability-of-suggested-edits">Per-site metas don&#39;t have ability of suggested-edits</a></p>

<p>I checked with several other moderators and the low traffic nature of this site (and really all the metas except for the main one that actually carries reputation on its own) means that it's something that would add another place for moderators to check for very few questions needing an edit. </p>

<p>Does this answer your question? Perhaps we can chat over the changes you'd like to make in a chat room?</p>
