<p>Saw this post <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/80135/help-i-need-help-here">Restoring a jailbroken iPhone</a> which IMO needed editing.
Though the edit link is displayed, it's unclickable. Only share is allowed.</p>

<p>Why?</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>The question had a pending edit by a user with low reputation (&lt;2000). This has to be approved by two users with reputation >=2000.</p>

<p>As both @Globalnomad and @Phorce have &lt; 2000 you cannot edit or approve it so you have to wait until the pending edit is approved. (I have approved it so only one more needed now)</p>
