	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>I recently made a substantial edit to this question:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/122400/how-do-i-upload-a-new-version-of-an-app-after-an-app-transfer">How do I upload a new version of an app after an App Transfer?</a></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xEEJK.png" alt="My Edit"></p>

<p>The OP then further edited the post to change an <code>I</code> to an <code>i</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NUhXM.png" alt="OP&#39;s Edit"></p>

<p>It was a very minor edit and the rollback would be equally minor, so should this be rolled back?</p>
