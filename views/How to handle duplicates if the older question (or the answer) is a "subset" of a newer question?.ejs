	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>I marked this question: <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/215279/mac-app-store-apps-damaged">Mac App Store apps damaged?</a> as a duplicate of a newer question <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/215332/many-os-x-app-store-apps-are-listed-as-app-is-damaged-and-cant-be-opened">Many OS X app store apps are listed as "app" is damaged and can't be opened</a>.</p>

<p>The reason to do it this way was that the newer question had a more general approach and presented one or more general answer(s) instead of a workaround.</p>

<p>Should I (always) mark the newer question as a duplicate of an older question though the older question is only a special case of the newer one?</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>The StackExchange developers view and voted up view is if the new question is better then close the old one as the duplicate from this <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/147643/should-i-vote-to-close-a-duplicate-question-even-though-its-much-newer-and-ha">MetaStackExchange question</a> (and that makes sense to me) Note this is not exactly your question but the other questions that match yours are closed as dups of this :(</p>

<p>In this case the new question and answer rather obviously are more general and detailed and would be the one that you want to read in the future. </p>

<p>The end result we want is the best question and answer.</p>
