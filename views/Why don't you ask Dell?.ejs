				<h2>Why don't you ask Dell?</h2>
<p>These questions get rather tiresome after a while...</p>

<p><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/261859/is-it-possible-to-connect-the-new-dell-31-5-inch-monitor-up3216q-at-3840x2160">Is it possible to connect the new DELL 31.5-inch monitor (UP3216Q) at 3840x2160 to the new macbook pro (late 2016)?</a></p>

<p>The chances of someone else on Ask Different having exactly the same setup with a brand new Mac &amp; monitor are so remote as to be infinitesimal.  </p>

<p>EveryMac, the usual go-to for these questions, doesn't cover every single possible plug &amp; socket on every possible Mac/monitor configuration. It just gives maximum resolutions.</p>

<p>We're left with, <em>"Why don't you ask Dell?"</em></p>

<p>I'm tempted to start closing them as Basic Customer Support.</p>

<p>Any opinions either way?</p>

				<p>Next time, just link to the dell support website for that monitor ;-)</p>

				<p>Unless the asker is engaged in a pattern of themselves asking many questions like that - it's best to take the high road and judge that post purely based on that one post and not in relation to many previous posts by other people.</p>

<ul>
<li>Why don't you ask Apple</li>
<li>Why don't you ask Dell</li>
<li>Why don't you ...</li>
</ul>

<p>All three of the above could be used to shut down just about any question here so I try to dismiss that thought and instead focus on if a question meets the quality standards of the site in general and in specific.</p>

<p>I personally wouldn't down vote <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/261859/is-it-possible-to-connect-the-new-dell-31-5-inch-monitor-up3216q-at-3840x2160">your example question it if it had one clear question</a> <em>(n.b. the initial version didn't have one clear question)</em>. Furthermore, if that initial version were closed as basic customer support and the OP edited it to have just one question instead of three - I'd be inclined to cast a binding reopen vote. <em>(which may have come to pass since the original version)</em></p>

<p>In this case - it's really a candidate for closing since it asks three questions. Two of which are bad but not forbidden. (the two bad questions are the yes/no questions on anyone trying it and the basic will it work).</p>

<p>There's a nugget of a good question, so rather than close it now - I'll edit it to surface what I see is it's best form. A question on how to read specs and determine compatibility.</p>

<p>Note - not everyone needs to save a marginal question. It's fine to down vote and forget it. It's fine to leave a comment asking the OP to edit down to one question. It's fine to vote as basic CS to vote as too broad or vote as unclear and move on.</p>

<p>Only moderators or people that cast a single binding close vote should analyze things as deeply as we are here splitting the needle. It's not a great question, but if we can be a little too generous or too kind on one off or first questions - that's not a bad thing.</p>
