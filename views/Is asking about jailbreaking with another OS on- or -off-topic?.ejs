	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>So, the question already on this Stack Exchange site says that it's OK to ask jailbreaking-related questions - as long as it doesn't violate piracy laws or suggest a criminal offence. </p>

<p><sub><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Jail-breaking or 'hacking' a product is not considered illegal, since you are the rightful owner of the device and may do with it whatever you see fit - <em>however</em> it <strong>does</strong> void your warranty and is not suggested by Apple Inc.</sub></p>

<p>Anyway, if you <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/492/41166">refer to this question</a> about jaibreaking, it's quite obvious that it's about the Apple product you are hacking.</p>

<p>But - is asking a question about a <strong><em>tool</em></strong> used for jailbreaking (such as the recent and first iOS6+ jailbreak tool <a href="http://evasi0n.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">evasi0n</a>) allowed? Furthermore, if you are using Linux or Windows as the tool's host - is it still on-topic or a place for L&amp;U or StackOverflow (etc.)?</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>Questions about jailbreak <em>tools</em> (i.e. software you run on your computer to make your iPhone/whatever do what you want it to do) seems like it would be on-topic here. The FAQ specifically says that "third-party hardware and software for Apple products" is on-topic. </p>

<p>This is a bit of an edge case if the software is to do something to your Apple product (i.e. jailbreak it), but the software itself does not run on an Apple product. In that case, I'd still think you'd be on-topic, but be aware that for the most part, this isn't a group of people whose specialty is Linux or Windows software, so while your question might be on-topic here, you might find a better answer on one of the other sites you named.</p>
