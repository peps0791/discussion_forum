				<h2>Question appearing on other site not just here on the SE</h2>
<p>I've just googled my email address to see whether i have any weird places that have it and I discovered this <a href="http://efreedom.com/Question/C-15005/Synchronizing-iPhone-Mailapp-Inboxes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">site</a> has take the question off the Apple SE. Is this allowed to happen? The orginal question is <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/15005/synchronizing-iphone-and-mail-app-inboxes">here</a>.</p>
