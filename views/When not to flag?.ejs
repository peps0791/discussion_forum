				<h2>When not to flag?</h2>
<p>I just went through my flags and saw that some were declined with the following reason:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>flags should only be used to make moderators aware of content that requires their intervention</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example: <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/141591/ios-create-un-resettable-and-undeletable-app">these</a> <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/128623/circuit-simulator-tool-for-os-x">two</a> questions were flagged as low quality and migratable respectively. These actions require mod intervention, but the flags were declined with the above reason.</p>

<p>So: why shouldn't I have flagged these type of questions?</p>

				<p>I declined that flag on the first question and honestly: I don't remember why. It was over half a year ago.</p>

				<p>@IanC. Oh, these were just two examples, I was more aiming at the general case.</p>

				<p>Yea, but usually I can look and it'd be something obvious like I'd rather you had down voted it or made an edit or something like that. But I have zero clue in this case. If you flagged that today I would have put it on hold. Sorry about that. Human and all that...</p>

				<p><p>In a nutshell, just because a flag was declined doesn't mean at all you shouldn't have raised them. I'll try to break down how I see things:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/141591/ios-create-un-resettable-and-undeletable-app">https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/141591/ios-create-un-resettable-and-undeletable-app</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I wouldn't flag it as low quality (which is what it looks like you chose). It's too broad / unclear - there's clearly something that would be on-topic. Unless there was a pattern of bad questions or spammy activity - I'd probably put it on hold instead of insta-deleting, but I didn't dig deeply into that user to see if/why it was handled for deletion.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/128623/circuit-simulator-tool-for-os-x">Circuit simulator tool for OS X?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This was flagged as other asking for migration. That flag should be declined since we cannot migrate anything more than a few months old. Even then, it's perfectly fine here.</p>

<hr>

<p>Apart from the specifics, here are things to consider in general when moderators handle flags. A problem arises when there are multiple flags on the same post. Sometimes a moderator has to choose the lesser of two evils and decline all flags if most of them are wrong. Also - sometimes I mis-click and decline a flag that should have been approved. I don't know if that happened, but if you end up with a dozen declines amongst 100 flags - I wouldn't worry. If you get 50% flags declined, then absolutely ask here for explanation, help, etc...</p>

				<p><p>When it comes to migration, our policy in the past here has been only to migrate if the poster requested it. If the post were off-topic here, we close. If the post is on-topic here, we leave it here unless the poster requests sending it somewhere else. So a migration flag from someone other than the OP would be declined. We've had pretty heavy moderator turnover since that policy was explained to me, so I don't know it that is current practice by all current mods, but that's what I was taught, and thus why I declined the flag in question.</p>

				<p><p>Regarding "low quality" flags in general, there isn't very much a moderator can do which non-mod users can't do as well</p>

<ul>
<li>downvote</li>
<li>leave a comment asking for clarification/improvements</li>
<li>improve the post directly by editing it (<em>this is actually the preferred option</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>That's why I tend to decline "low quality" flags from higher-rep users (with higher rep starting at the point where the user gets access to the review queue).</p>

				<p>This is also the approach I take. It doesn't take a mod to down vote a low quality answer. If something is ambiguously an answer, but low quality, I'll decline the flag. Users are expected to be voting on SE sites.</p>
