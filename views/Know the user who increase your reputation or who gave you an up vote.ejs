				<h2>Know the user who increase your reputation or who gave you an up vote</h2>
<p>I'm still new here and not yet familiar with many of the features of the forum.</p>

<p>I would like to know if there is a way to determine or know the user who increased your reputation or who gave you an up vote.</p>

<p>Back then we have a Philippine version of Stackoverflow.com for Filipino programmers and we had there a feature that displays the list and history of users who gave you an up vote.</p>

<p>Do we have it here also?</p>

				<p><p>No, on Stack Exchange sites like this one there is no simple way for ordinary users to see who has voted on a post.</p>

<p>While it would sometimes be fun to know who gave you an up/down vote, anonymized voting is important as it allows people to vote based on the post itself without worrying about maintaining friendships or not offending anyone.</p>
