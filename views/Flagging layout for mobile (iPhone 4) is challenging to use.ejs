				<h2>Flagging layout for mobile (iPhone 4) is challenging to use</h2>
<p>I tried flagging a few posts using the iPhone 4 / Mobile interface, and the layout far exceeds the screen size. </p>

<p>The initial box for flagging and closing looks good and survives a portrait to landscape switch well. The bug happens when choosing "exact duplicate" and the text input box exceeds the bounds of the screen. </p>

<p>This makes it very difficult to operate the buttons and provide a link to the dupe.  My attempts to pinch / zoom or scale my way out of this failed. Rotating the device to landscape helped a little, but it was still not very workable.</p>
