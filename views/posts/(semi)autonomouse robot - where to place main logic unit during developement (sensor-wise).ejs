				<h2>(semi)autonomouse robot - where to place main logic unit during developement (sensor-wise)</h2>
<p>I want to make autonomous universal inteligent moving robot (with laser gun turret and rockets and warp drive and everything of course). I found, that it is not so easy task, so I choose approach of dividing it to small steps.</p>

<p>My idea is a lot of units (motors, sensors, lasers, communications, ...) all connected to I2C bus, all communicating in logical way rather then just technical values (so "warp 5 ahead" rather than "PWM 70 to pins 4 and 6", or "motors stopped due overheating" rather than "analogRead(A2)=786") and "master unit" making tactical and strategical decision instead of micromanaging everything.</p>

<p>So far I have </p>

<ul>
<li>tested some ultrasound sensors</li>
<li>managed to read IR TV remote</li>
<li>created clock with lap time and many other functions, while driving display 7segments in Timer ISR (so interrupts does not scare me more :)</li>
</ul>

<p>for the robot itself I already</p>

<ul>
<li>created library to easily manage arbitrary number of motor shields over I2C</li>
<li>created two such I2C driven shields </li>
<li>attached them to motors on two tracks undercarriage (with bateries and regulators etc.etc)</li>
<li>created simple "master unit" which commands them over I2C (but it have just stupid demo which runs predefined parrent of "run/rotate this fast for so long" in cycle)</li>
</ul>

<p>so it blindly runs on the floor just now.</p>

<p>Next step is to create unit for ultrasound (which answer to "how far?" and screams activelly "we are going to crash soon") and let "master unit" react on it (no move ahead if anything sooner than 5cm).</p>

<p>Now I am hacking gamepad to be "temporaly" input device to make easier testing any new function (so many buttons and 2 joysticks inside so it is convenient device to trigger anything) and demonstrate, how far I got. Also to play with it for just fun. The gamepad will have "arduino" inside and will communicate over I2C too (over long wire - I tested that it works reliably already).</p>

<hr>

<p>Now the question:</p>

<p>With sensors and motors on the board (and some bupers too soon and more sensors) on one hand</p>

<p>and so much buttons and analog joysticks in the gamepad on the other hand</p>

<p><strong>what arrangement is more likely to help me continue on the way?</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>gamepad as pure universal input device - send 17 bits for buttons pressed (packed to 3 bytes send on button change only) and 4 signed bytes for joysticks (on regular interval if joysticks are moving) (both also possible to ask for) - and master unit on board resolving it to any logic</p>

<ul>
<li>gamepad would not change and would serve like any other sensor</li>
<li>master unit is changing constantly anyway, so lets decode what button triggers here (like testing functions, rotating left or what) </li>
<li>makes the master code lot longer and gamepad HW dependent</li>
<li>gamepad spams a lot with joystick moves (even if not used)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>gamepad as inteligent device sending "commands" and reporting "states"</p>

<ul>
<li>means to assing all the keys some sense and reprogram that and master any time I want to test new functionality</li>
<li>master simpler, cleaner design</li>
<li>gamepad spams less with joystick moves and unassigned buttons change</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>gamepad as <code>ovelord</code>, managing its keys and all, asking <code>master</code> for robot state and commanding <code>master</code> what to do, while <code>master</code> would command all units on robot platform</p>

<ul>
<li>maybe a way to easy switch to some computer (Rapsberry/laptop) on board, running some OS like linux and using big storage for maps/ high level strategy and so</li>
<li>lot of duplicity in <code>master</code> as many commands would be just resend without much modification/added value</li>
<li>more communication over I2C due the duplicity</li>
</ul></li>
<li>gamepad as <code>master</code>, no master on board

<ul>
<li>the robot would not be able to even move without gamepad (at least laying on the board)</li>
<li><code>master</code> (gamepad) responible to many inputs itself (buttons, joysticks)</li>
<li>lot less communication over I2C, as everything is solved inside the gamepad</li>
<li>less processors, the <code>master</code> code could be later moved to computer on board and leave out the gamepad totally</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>(uhm lol, took me 5 hours to write all of this and a lot became clearer to me, when I was trying to express it in letters :)</p>
