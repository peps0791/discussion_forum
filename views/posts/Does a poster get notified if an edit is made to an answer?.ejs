				<p>@Tetsujin Correct. If the user has commented on the answer, you can ping them normally to [notify them of an edit](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/173302/in-terminal-how-do-i-add-a-host-key-to-the-file-known-hosts/173303#comment203841_173303). If not, you can comment on the question to notify them, however this is not ideal and causes noise (remove the comment once OP has seen it). Chat is also an option.</p>

				<p><p>Edits that other people make to posts which are yours (both questions and answers) will cause an edit notification to show in your inbox.</p>

<p> <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o1a86.png" width="374"></p>

<p>However, these notifications are not sent for minor edits. Edits need to be substantiative enough for the system to deem it necessary to notify you. For more information, see Meta.SE:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/202359/no-notification-was-received-for-an-edit-to-a-post">No notification was received for an edit to a post</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order to reduce noise sent to users, we only notify when "substantive" changes are happening on their posts.</p>
  
  <p>There are a few rules in how "substantive" is defined, but typically one of these two should be enough to trigger a message:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>the edit in the post body should be over a threshold</li>
  <li>the edit in code sections should be over another threshold</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The threshold varies from site to site.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notifications are not sent to the user who asked a question if an answer to their question is edited.</p>

				<p>I swapped my 15-point flag, then ;) I have occasionally wondered why nothing ever happens if I suddenly get a brainstorm on an answer I posted days before, & add what is *actually* the right answer. So, I need to drop a comment into the OP to actually let them know there was a change</p>
