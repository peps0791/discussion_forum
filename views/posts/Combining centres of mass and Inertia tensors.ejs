				<h2>Combining centres of mass and Inertia tensors</h2>
<p>I'm trying to build the dynamic model of a 6DOF robot, and the company that has built it, kindly provides a document having the masses, centres of mass, principal axes of inertia and principal moments of inertia taken at the center of mass, taken at the center of mass and aligned with the output coordinate system, and taken at the output coordinate system (I've come to known that this was obtained from a tool in SolidWorks)</p>

<p>The robot has 6 actuators responsible for the motion of each one of the 6 links available. The problem that I have here is the way I should calculate the inertia matrix $M(q)$. Since the matrix has to have a 6x6 dimension, I know that I have to do some kind of "combining" between one link and the correspondent actuator. 
The problem is that I don't really know how can I find the respective centre of mass between the two "objects" and the respective moment of inertia of the "multiobject". I've seen people saying that it is simply the summation of the respective moments of inertia but they need to be in respect to the same orientation and translation.</p>

<p>Can anyone shed some light into this? Suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

				<p>It may help to add some of the equations relevant to the point at which you are stuck. Are you trying to add actuator mass to link mass? Add the actuator rotor dynamics to your dynamics calcs? Get M(q) from the manufacturer provided mass info? It's not clear.</p>

				<p>@hauptmech Yes, basically I want to combine the mass of both the actuator and the link and the respective inertia tensors. The mass I assume I can simply add them together. The inertia tensor I believe it's not that straightforward.</p>

			<div id = "comment-21761" class = "comment">
				<p>If you write the equations for moments of inertia, and talk through what they mean, it should be clear how to combine multiple moment of inertia matrices. If you put all this in an answer to your question it will help others and we will be able to confirm your reasoning.</p>

				<p><p><a href="http://studywolf.wordpress.com/2013/09/07/robot-control-3-accounting-for-mass-and-gravity/amp/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">This site about robotics</a> walks you through how you can define the link inertias in the local frame, then use transformations to come up with $M$.  It is pretty straightforward.  Just remember to define link parameters locally, then premultipy by the appropriate transformation. </p>

				<p>Thanks for the suggestion. Unfortunately, that wasn't particularly what I was looking for. That example only takes into account the links of the robot. For my problem I really have to calculate with the links + actuators, and that , I assume, requires additional math. Thanks anyways.</p>

				<p>You're welcome.  It's not really different if you consider what defines an individual link's moment of inertia.  You can just take each link, including everything that is attached to the link and rotates with it (so you can include all attached "things," such as the next distal actuator), and compute the moment of inertia for that combined set of masses.  Then follow the steps to create $M$.   Good luck!</p>
