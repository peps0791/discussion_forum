				<h2>V-REP quadcopter propeller thrust</h2>
<p>I'm trying to develop a controller for the quadcopter available in V-rep using LUA scripting. While taking a look at the code for the propellers, I noticed that the thrust is calculated like this:</p>

<pre><code>totalExertedForce=particleCnt*particleDensity*particleVelocity*math.pi*particleSize*particleSize*particleSize/(6*ts)
</code></pre>

<p>The complete script can be found <a href="https://pastebin.com/6V6rsuRd" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p>Printing the result from the variable above results in a value of 1.2 to 1.3 when the quadcopter is stable. What is the meaning of this value, and in what unit is it? </p>

<p>Considering the mass of the quadcopter is 120g (seen in the Scene Object Properties of the quadcopter), the force necessary to keep the quadcopter in the air should be mass*g, which is aprox. 1.2 Newtons... But that's for the entire quadcopter! So these 1.2 to 1.3 of "totalExertedForce" clearly cannot be Newtons, since otherwise, considering there are 4 propellers, there would be a total force of 1.2*4 = 4.8N produced by the propellers, resulting in a net force of 3N in the Z axis of the quadcopter.</p>

<p>I noticed that the main script of the quadcopter actually sets the variable "particleVelocity", and following the thrust formula available <a href="https://quadcopterproject.wordpress.com/static-thrust-calculation/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> (number 3), assuming that particleVelocity is the velocity of the air accelerated by the propeller, and multiplying the result by the 4 propellers, gives something close to the actual weight of the quadcopter (1.2N)... which would mean that the variable "totalExertedForce" has nothing to do with the actual thrust produced by the quadcopter.</p>

<p>This left me extremely confused as to how the script works, so, can anyone explain how it actually works, and what are the physics behind it?</p>

				<p>Welcome to *Robotics*, Chi. Could you please clarify your question? You appear to spend nearly the entire text referring to a force calculation, then end the question asking about an angular velocity. If this is a question about how to use a particular piece of *software*, then the question should probably be asked on the [v-rep forums](http://www.forum.coppeliarobotics.com/index.php) or over at [so]. If you're curious how the force calculation is derived, then that's fine here, but you'll need to post more of the code such that it's clear what the terms are and how they're calculated.</p>

				<p>Notice that the variable name you're quoting is `totalExertedForce`, not `propForce` or something else. The `totalExertedForce` you're outputting is in line with what you're expecting for... the total exerted force. It looks like a [thrust equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust#Thrust_to_power).</p>

			<div id = "comment-22823" class = "comment">
				<p>I now understand that thrust is directly proporcional to the square of the angular velocity of the propeller, meaning that in real life, I would have to find the "magic" number that relates thrust to angular velocity in order to actually implement the controller. So, for simulation, I can just set the thrust or air velocity.</p>

				<p>@Chuck this is a question about both how the software works and what are the physics behind it, so I thought it was appropriate for the robotics stack exchange. But maybe you are right, the v-rep forums may be a better place to ask such a thing.</p>
