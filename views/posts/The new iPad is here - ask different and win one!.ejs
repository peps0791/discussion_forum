<p>Apple recently announced the revamped and recharged iPad, and they hit stores today. This new iteration of Apple s tablet features impressive quad core graphics, and state of the art Retina technology for higher def viewing. The new iPad continues to set the standard for elegance in design and advancements in performance and technology. </p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6lZHE.png" height="255"></p>

<p>We re impressed. Are you?</p>

<p>In our corner of the Apple universe, we continue to build a comprehensive resource helping those who dare to ask different. To celebrate the new benchmark in tablet computing, we ordered a few for you, in case to you didn t have the chance to.</p>

<p>Because we can t give new iPads to everyone (we wish that we could!), people who participate on Ask Different during the next few weeks to different degrees earn different Apple products. Visit the Ask Different <a href="http://thenewipadishere.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">iPad Contest Page</a> for specific details on how these iPads (and iPods) are being given away.</p>

				<p>If it's reasonably easy to ship it to you, yes we will work something out. Either we will ship it to you or you can buy it yourself and we can reimburse you.

				<p><p>I am really excited at how well worded and thought through this contest is. I appreciate the explanation about how the raffle will work and what might happen if more people qualify than prizes are available. I personally dislike open ended raffles where you don't know how long or how many items are intended to be offered as prizes and that cheapens the promotion in my opinion. In this case - having the status update as we ask/answer/share is really making this fun to track progress of everyone.</p>

<p>I have one question. Level one enters you in the raffle. Does level two get you a second entry in the same raffle or perhaps is there a second raffle for just the people that have Level two contributions?</p>

				<p>Good question - there is only one raffle, which will include people who finish both Level 1 and Level 2. Level 2 does not get you a second entry into the raffle - the benefit of finishing Level 2 over Level 1 is that you get an iPod Touch.</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-2183" class = "comment">
				<p>Good stuff - for clarity and as an advocate of Plain English, if you remove the comment about Raffle Entry from Level 2 it tightens everything up, because you cannot get to L2 without already having done L1 anyway, so the comment is redundant and leads to confusion evidenced by this question.</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-2199" class = "comment">
				<p>That's a good point. I don't want to change this one, because I can see people being confused and thinking we are no longer entering Level 2s into the raffle. But I'll work on making it clearer for next time.</p>
