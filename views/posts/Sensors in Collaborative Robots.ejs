				<h2>Sensors in Collaborative Robots</h2>
<p>I'm currently doing some research on collaborative robotics. One area of interest is the type of sensor(s) used in these kind of machines. </p>

<p>I had a look at some robots by FANUC and Universal Robots and I've noticed that they do not come equipped with sensors; they are sold as an add-on.</p>

<p>Is this inherent with collaborative robots? Do customers need to buy sensors as an add-on - which has advantages and disadvantages. </p>

<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

				<p>Please explain what sensors you are talking about. What are those add-on sensors of robots from FANUC and Universal Robots? Your question seems to make the claim that these robots do not come with any sensors at all, which I doubt is true.</p>

				<p>I'm guessing that this might refer to robots who "collaborate" in the sense that they execute pre-scripted actions in unison, whereas the sensors provide some way to react to any obstacles that are encountered while executing those actions.  It's difficult to say without a link to whatever documentation this question refers to.</p>

				<p>Please [define what you mean](http://blog.robotiq.com/what-does-collaborative-robot-mean) when you say collaborative robot. What "sensors" do you think they should come with? I would bet they all have position sensors.</p>

				<p>Hi @Ian - you are right. A typical robot has sensors such as a camera or a torque sensor or a light sensor. When looking at collaborative robots such as the ones from FANUC they do not seem to have any sensors: Here is the datasheet for one of their robots: [link](http://robot.fanucamerica.com/products/robots/images/CR-35iA-product-info.pdf) But a collaborative robot _should_ have a sensor to make it aware of its environment and how to react to certain actions that might occur: like a human getting in his way</p>

				<p><p>This question seems to be about robots collaborating with people -- not with each other.  In general, it might be unsafe for a person to stand near a machine that's capable of exerting harmful levels of force in any given direction.  One way to avoid that, as is mentioned in the question, is by using sensors to detect any human-like objects in its path.</p>

<p>However, robots can still be safe even without internal sensors.  The <a href="http://support.barrett.com/wiki/WAM/SafetyFeaturesPrecautions" rel="nofollow">WAM arm has configurable torque limits</a> -- read from its own motors --, which can be set low enough such that the arm will disable itself if it runs into something.</p>

<p>You could also do <a href="https://pr2s.clearpathrobotics.com/wiki/Safety/Design" rel="nofollow">what the PR2 robot does: exert very little force in each of its joints</a>.  </p>

<p>Keep in mind that just because the robot senses something, it needs a fair amount of intelligence and mechanical capability to act in a way that will protect a person.  In other words, the simple safety designs are just as important as the sophisticated ones.</p>

				<p>Thanks for the explanation but why is it that I cannot find the types of sensors used in the robot? I can tell the type of actuator etc but not the sensors. Can I assume that additional sensors need to be bought depending on how the robot is going to be implemented?</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-18753" class = "comment">
				<p>The link you posted seems to be a product brochure, and so it's not surprising that they call it simply a "safety sensor".  I wouldn't be surprised if they withheld that information even if you called them and said "I'd like to buy one of these, but please tell me what type of technology is used for the sensor".  If you did contact them, I'd ask what the detection capabilities are and try to match those with a sensor technology.</p>

				<p><p>Very little is inherent to collaborative robots, and this is especially true for sensors. </p>

<p>The term 'collaborative robot' is still new in the industrial world and there is a bit of hype and variation in meaning in what exactly they are talking about.</p>

<p>In general a collaborative robot will be one that expected to do its work with a human in its workspace. There is <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=62996" rel="nofollow">ISO standardization</a> around this and the <a href="http://www.infoplc.net/files/documentacion/robotica/infoPLC_net_Industrial_HRC_ERF2014_.pdf" rel="nofollow">focus is on safety</a>.</p>

<p>In the domain of collaboration, there are two main things we want to do in my view. </p>

<p>1) We want to know where the human is relative to the robot so we can operate the robot in a more performance oriented manner when the human is far enough away. This could be as simple as always moving safely and stopping (moving even more safely) when in contact with a human. It could be as complex as tracking human kinematics and moving more 'dangerously' based on the distance between the robot and person and the dynamics between them. Think of the knife-between-fingers scene in Aliens.</p>

<p>2) We want to receive commands from the human so that the robot can collaborate. This might be lead-through teach and play programming, or one might simply sit down at a robot workbench and block off the area you want to use with your arms, like a little kid at the art table establishing their space. </p>

<p>You can see this is a big domain with a lot of possibilities. So when it comes to specific products, you will have to sit down with each vendor to find out what exactly is 'collaborative' about their robot and what package of options is needed to achieve that collaboration. There is no standard of what collaboration means, nor what sensing is used.</p>

<p>One thing to note is that collaboration is completely separate from the actual task of the robot. End tooling, tool changers, fixtures, etc all need to be considered in addition.</p>

				<p>Welcome to *Robotics* robotics1, but please read [What kind of behavior is expected of users?](https://robotics.stackexchange.com/help/behavior) and [How not to be a spammer](https://robotics.stackexchange.com/help/promotion). The way this was written, it looks less like an answer and more like an advert for your product. The technology referenced in your answer is commonly referred to as a [light curtain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_curtain).</p>

			<div id = "comment-22904" class = "comment">
				<p>I know, and I thought about it but thought the OP could find it useful to know about it. The video is informative I hope. I dont want to sell anything. But no, it is not a light curtain because a light curtain needs 2 pillars and the space between is the barrier. Using infra-red you have just one device which can reach any distance up to 6 feet. Now it looks even more like an ad so do delete if you wish. I also worry that there is a lot of hype about "cobots". You can not assume they are safe just because they have the label "collaborative robot". You must do risk assessments.</p>

				<p>I don't mind so much if it looks like an ad or not, *as long as you disclose your relationship*. My first thought was that the solution looked like an array of [Leap Motion devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_Motion), and it sounds like, from your description, that it's not too far off. We could chat more about this in [chat], if you would like. I'm fine to leave your answer with comments as-is, also.</p>
