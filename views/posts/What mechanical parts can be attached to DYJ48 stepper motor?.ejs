				<h2>What mechanical parts can be attached to DYJ48 stepper motor?</h2>
<p>Sorry I am asking a mechanical question here, but, after all, where else people have experience with using motors? If there is a better forum for this, please do guide me.</p>

<p>Everywhere I've seen online, the stepper motor DYJ48 is used in tutorials, to rotate on its own, or, at most, to spin a clothes pin attached to it. I am trying to get Arduino to work for my 10 year old kid. He's got the motor rotating, now what? How does he attach anything to it?</p>

<p>Don't laugh, I made him a wheel out of a raw potato. He is happy with it now. Where can I find any guidance as to what to do next?</p>

				<p>Do you mean one of these: http://robocraft.ru/files/datasheet/28BYJ-48.pdf It looks like a 9mm diameter shaft with two flats. One technique is to get a plastic wheel with a smaller hole, and a very old, unloved soldering iron. Heat up the iron, push it into the hole, and while the plastic is hot, push it onto the shaft. Otherwise a wheel with a 9mm hole with two grub screws screwed against the flats might work.</p>

				<p>Of course, the modern answer is 'use a 3D printer'. That's how we do stuff. Failing that, has his school got a laser cutter? The problem isn't just making a hole the right shape, it also needs to be in the centre.</p>

				<p>I am not sure many elementary schools have laser cutters. If they did, where would it be? 3D Printer - yes, I am exploring it now, found 3dhubs.com (or are there better places to print? Not quite ready to invest in a 3d printer just yet).</p>

				<p>The next question is, which 3D editor to use. Tried FreeCAD, but it does not seem to allow to create shapes from scratch.

				<p>Yes @venny! Polymorph!! It'd make a good adapter for a large enough hole. Hot glue works too, and maybe easier to get. We use Sketchup, but run it on older Windows.</p>

				<p><p>You can drill a hole to match the shaft into whatever it is and either fix it with a setscrew against the flat or glue it. Or you could glue a brass tube (hobby shop) to the shaft if you can find one that fits. The shaft is 5mm diameter, as venny says. </p>

<p>Of course it's easier if you have access to a small lathe (such as Sherline or one of the small Chinese ones). </p>

<p>If you need to allow for misalignment between shafts it's better to buy or make a shaft coupler such as these helical style ones: </p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8kY8F.jpg" alt="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Flexible-Coupling-Motor-Shaft-Coupler-3mm-X-5mm-/220977869760"></p>

<p>There are other types (some of which have a bit of backlash). You can also use a collar with setscrews, but the shaft on that motor is a bit stubby and that type of coupler allows for almost no shaft misalignment so it would jam easily (and the motor is not very powerful). The kind with backlash generally has a bit of flexible material such as urethane rubber sandwiched between two interlocking sets of fingers. </p>

<p>I made a sky tracking drive using one of these cr*p motors and I just drilled out the center of a standard gear (from Stock Drive) a bit to get a slip fit and used the grub screw to secure it. The shaft is pretty stubby so it's hard to get something secured to it unless it fits very tightly or is a clamp or collet-style fixing. In my case, the gear drives a nut that works on a leadscrew. </p>

<p>BTW, you might find the robotics SE useful in this kind of thing. I've not looked at it once, but those folks run into this sort of thing regularly. </p>

				<p><p>The diameter of the shaft is 5mm, it sould be possible to use a 5mm propeller collet commonly used on RC airplanes, like this one:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hobbyexpress.com/images_products/1199_large.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer">pic http://www.hobbyexpress.com/images_products/1199_large.jpg</a></p>

<p>Tightening the nut secures the attached object and at the same time it clamps the collet to the shaft.</p>

<p>The shaft should be inserted fully into the clamp, to grip also the non-flattened portion to provide good stability.</p>

				<p><p>I found, that carefully filing the shaft down to 2mm will make it a perfect fit for lego gears. 
You will have to file the flat sides. You can check uniformity of your work by light reflection. The shaft indentation in the front works as center guide, so you take off from both sides evenly. You also might have to slightly round the edges. </p>

<p>If you don't like that, try an adapter: check whether your local library has a 3d printer (some are setting up science labs for kids). 
There are a handful adapters for this motor (lego, round axis, servo,..) which you can download and print on a 3d printer. </p>

				<p><p>It is amazing that there are so few solutions for power transfer for such a common motor. I have looked at ebay and amazon. Gears are available in a wide range of prices, none that are in the same scale as the price of this cheap motor. There is a gear generator at <a href="http://woodgears.ca/gear/help3/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://woodgears.ca/gear/help3/index.html</a> for wood gears. This or 3d printing gives you the flexibility of gear ratios and shaft sizes. I just wanted to be able to connect a programmable motor to a drive that would actually do something.  </p>
