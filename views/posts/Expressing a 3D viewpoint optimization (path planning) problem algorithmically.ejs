				<h2>Expressing a 3D viewpoint optimization (path planning) problem algorithmically</h2>
<p>I am working on a path planning approach for multiple robots where their main goal is to move to positions that allow for significantly better vision based reconstruction of a given scene. Each robot moves in 3D space and contains a monocular camera, so they collaborate with each other to perform feature matching and reconstruction (like a next-best-view problem, but with multiple robots collaborating to generate a 'view'). </p>

<p>In the beginning, the robots have a partial knowledge of the scene, i.e., a (probably sparse) feature map. Using this information, the aim is to prioritize better matching through fronto-parallel views as well as feature overlap while also considering the travel cost of the robots. I express the overlap, visibility etc. as a set of heuristics: assuming there are two robots/cameras located at 3D coordinates $P_1$ and $P_2$ (ignoring orientation freedom for simplicity); I can estimate what their viewpoints would look like and compute how many features will be visible from there and how much overlap is generated between both cameras. Subsequently, I want to find positions for the robots such that these metrics are maximized, so the robots move towards locations that will generate maximum overlap and feature visibility. At the same time, I also want my cost function to take into account the cost required to travel to these places. For instance, I show an example below: I can use only two robots to reconstruct a scene; but because of field of view limitations, the best I can do is from farther away with a high vergence angle which could affect matching, or I can send three robots to do it with better matching, at the expense of a higher cost. I have a simple weighted cost function that combines the previous metrics and path cost of the robots.</p>

<p>Being new to planning, I am having trouble expressing these constraints and decision making algorithmically. Initially, I tried out a random-sampling based approach where I evaluate each sample based on the metrics I mentioned above. This turned out to be pretty ineffective as the sampling was purely random and has no guarantees on finding a solution. On the other hand, I am not sure if incremental solutions (like a descent) would be applicable, because I am not sure how to express this as an actual mathematical function that only depends on the robot coordinates. Any suggestions/pointers would be very helpful!</p>
