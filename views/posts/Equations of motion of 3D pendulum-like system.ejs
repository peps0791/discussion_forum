				<h2>Equations of motion of 3D pendulum-like system</h2>
<p>I'm trying to get the equations of motion of a 3D pendulum system (spherical pendulum), however I don't want to describe the system using spherical coordinates (which there is lot of information about). </p>

<p>Instead I want to describe the system using x,y,z coordinates of the mass as well as the euler angles phi, theta, psi (the roll, pitch and yaw of the mass). 
That is, I want to assume that the mass has a position and an orientation in relation to the inertial frame. </p>

<p>Furthermore this is a 3D pendulum system, where the mass, which is symmetric, is actuated (notice that this is a simplification of the system needed to actuate the mass, where only the resulting forces and torques are taken into account):</p>

<ul>
<li>There is a force F acting in the x-axis direction of the mass reference frame</li>
<li>There is a torque T acting about the z-axis of the mass reference frame</li>
<li>There is also the gravitational force acting on the center of mass (in the negative direction of z-axis of the inertial reference frame</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to clear misconceptions about how this forces are generated, think of the mass as a differential drive robot using fans instead of wheels.</p>

<p>The cable connecting the mass to the anchor point is assumed rigid and works as a distance constraint modeled by:
$\|r_{anchor} - r_{mass}\| = cable\_length$</p>

<p>Where $r_{anchor}$ is the position of the anchor point to which the mass is connected through the cable and $r_{mass}$ is the position of the mass. This constraint makes it so that it is similar to having two spherical joints: one at the anchor point and another at the mass. Futhermore the cable is assumed to have no mass. 
It's important to note that this rigid connection (calbe) is meant to be modeled by the distant constraint refered above.</p>

<p>I'm looking for help solving this system to obtain its equations of motion.
Thanks in advance</p>

				<p>One formula for torque is $\tau = I\alpha$ - moment of inertia times angular acceleration. Newton's third law says there's an equal and opposite (torque) for every (torque), so the cable, being massless, has a moment of inertia of zero. The joints, being spherical, cannot transmit a torque, so the reaction torque for the z-axis torque actuator in the mass is zero.</p>

				<p>I'll make the observation first that your mass frame doesn't appear to be oriented the way I had assumed it would be - with z pointing toward the anchor. This leads me to wonder if your mass frame is actually the frame *for your mass* or if it's a frame aligned with the global coordinates located at the center of mass of the sphere. I say this to now reiterate an earlier comment - I don't know how you can apply a force in the x-axis of the mass' frame without strapping a fan on. Wind or similar would mean it's applied along the *global* frame's x-axis.</p>

			<div id = "comment-18868" class = "comment">
				<p>And finally, I'm not sure if you really mean the cable connects to the sphere via a spherical joint at COM of the sphere, but if so (and if the joint has no friction or damping) then the sphere's orientation never changes for the same reason the z-axis torque doesn't do anything - there's never any moment about that joint.</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-18869" class = "comment">
				<p>I've reopened the question because there *is* an answer now, but it's pretty mundane: $\ddot{\theta}=-(g/L) \sin\theta$. If the anchor joint could transmit torque (where universal vs spherical), or the rope connected to the top of the sphere instead of the COM, or it were possible to transmit torque up the cable - a lot of things could make this a very, very difficult problem. It still could be, if you take Earth into account (Focault pendulum), but as it stands it's just a 2D pendulum rotated into a third dimension. Unless you want to edit your assumptions.</p>

				<p>@Chuck The mass/sphere component can be thought of as a differential drive robot with fans instead of wheels. The force and torque presented are a result of such structure. Furthermore, when trying to obtain the equations of motion for this system, the cable is modeled by the holomonic constraint $\|r_{anchor} - r_{mass}\| = cable\_length$, instead of a rigid connection.</p>

			<div id = "comment-18881" class = "comment">
				<p>If you want to use a Cartesian coordinates frame, then you could model the cable as a spring with a very high stiffness (and then use F=ma).</p>
