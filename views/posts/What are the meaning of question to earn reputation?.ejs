				<h2>What are the meaning of question to earn reputation?</h2>
<p>Sorry if the title is not so clear. </p>

<p>Should we remove the questions that are made for the purpose of earn only reputation points? I'm referring to question like these two: <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/231835/what-are-the-differences-between-the-iphone-se-6s-and-6s-plus?noredirect=1#comment283184_231835">1</a>, <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/231833/what-are-the-differences-between-the-9-7-and-12-9-ipad-pros">2</a>.</p>

<p>I mean, are those really necessary for the community? They look like spam to me. Especially because the answer arrive from the person who made the question in only 6 minutes. </p>

<p>Some of you expert can provide me some explanation in order to keep questions like that?</p>

				<p><p>If you disagree with a question you can always flag it for closing. The flags will be reviewed by the moderators and the community users. If enough people agree a question should be closed the system will take care of it; no humans need intervene.</p>

<p>That being said, over time, we've gotten pretty good as a community at recognizing the common questions that occur post-Apple announcement of new products and heading off those questions from very low-rep users with existing self-answered questions.</p>

<p>This is an accepted practice here on Ask Different.</p>

<p>You've provided to examples but they're both slightly different.</p>

<p>In the case of <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/231835/what-are-the-differences-between-the-iphone-se-6s-and-6s-plus">What are the differences between the iPhone SE, 6s, and 6s plus?</a> -- the user asked a pretty straight-forward question and self-answered. Nothing wrong with that and it's something that's done post-Apple announcement with some frequency here. There's good prior art for this sort of thing on the site.</p>

<p>And a slight diversion here: answering your own questions is not only okay, it's <em>encouraged</em> by the Stack Exchange system. You have an "answer your own question" box right below the "ask your question" box when you're creating a new question. Stack Exchange exists to capture questions and answers with as few rules as possible. Sometimes people know the question <em>and</em> the answer and why wouldn't we want them to share this knowledge with the world?</p>

<p>However, for the second question you linked to, <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/231833/what-are-the-differences-between-the-9-7-and-12-9-ipad-pros">What are the differences between the 9.7  and 12.9  iPad Pros?</a> -- the asker did not provide an answer. It needs an answer. And it's a legit question. We will see people asking what the differences are between the two models.</p>

<p>The simplicity of a question or the ease with which an answer can be obtained aren't good measures for whether a question should be asked here or not. We certainly don't mind simple or easy-to-answer questions!</p>

<p>I will say that your answer on the "What are the differences between the 9.7  and 12.9  iPad Pros?" is not a good answer. We strongly discourage "read the text behind a link" answers here. Links rot, which means the text behind them gets lots. Pull the relevant details in to your answer in addition to providing the link would make it a stronger answer. As written, it will attract down votes.</p>
