				<h2>About official robotics system toolbox Matlab and Peter Corke Robotics toolbox matlab.</h2>
<p>I came to know that matlab released robotics system toolbox in 2016 version but I'm using Matlab 2014b. At that time I installed Peter Corke Robotics toolbox matlab and start working on it. I develop few GUI and wrote others code too using the same Peter Corke Robotics toolbox. But now I want to install new official version of robotics toolbox. But my doubt is if I install new version then what happen to older one. Will I  able to run my old codes (which used old toolbox) on matlab after installing new official version or it may vanish older one. Will matlab shows error in my codes or GUI after installing new version. I want to work with both toolbox.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

				<p>Peter Corke's Robotics toolbox and MATLAB's official Robotics System Toolbox are geared towards somewhat different things. Some functions like RPY to rotation matrix etc. might be present in both toolboxes but it's unlikely they would have the exact same names (for example, Euler to rotation matrix in MATLAB's toolbox is eul2rotm, in Dr Corke's toolbox is eul2tr.. etc.).</p>

				<p><p>The problem you're likely to face with using an outdated third party toolbox with Matlab is that Mathworks occasionally changes how some functions are performed, which requires changes to how the inputs should be assigned and/or how the outputs should be used.</p>

<p>One of the bigger changes I can think of in recent updates is the graphics engine update that came with 2015b. I preferred the older graphics package at the time, but have come to appreciate the newer graphics. The big change that I noticed was that <code>drawnow</code> (or <code>pause</code>) is required any time you want to update the frame (as in during animations). </p>

<p>Generally speaking, though, if you attempt to call a function that has had its functionality changed in an update, Matlab will issue a warning notifying you that the syntax for that function has changed. </p>

<p>If you're especially concerned, you can download (request trials if required, just tell them you're checking compatibility) versions along the way (2015a, 2015b, etc.) and check that your code works correctly at each instance. </p>

<p>I would certainly have a simulation pre-configured in a functional and known to be correct form first, and then you can check that the results are the same across versions and that the results are the same as what you get from the official toolbox. </p>

<p>As I mentioned in a previous post, the third party toolbox is for an outdated version of Matlab and hasn't been updated itself in years, so I would be reluctant to use it at all. If you're going to have the third party and official toolboxes installed simultaneously, then I would suggest you get yourself acclimated to the new toolbox by attempting to translate your existing "known good" work. Official toolboxes are maintained by Mathworks and you get tech support, too.</p>

<p>For the record, too, you stated you're using 2014b - the official Robotics Systems Toolbox was first released for 2015a, so you'd only need to upgrade one version if you're really concerned about compatibility issues. 2015b was the big update.</p>
