				<h2>Where is the list of canonical questions stored for Ask Different?</h2>
<p>Where can we store a list of questions that are considered canonical?</p>

<p>Canonical means that it's asked frequently enough to warrant an excellent clear and detailed answer that the site edits and maintains so that it's broad, clear and helps many people troubleshoot or solve a common issue or misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Rather than blame people for coming and asking the same question over and over, the intent is to organize and realize that this will never and and instead have an efficient manner to link these to canonical answers.</p>

<p>That way, if the new asker actually has a different question, it will be easier for them to edit the post and get it reopened. It also will signal to the community that the answers are going to be heavily used and that it's worth it to keep them current, clear, and exemplary so that they can shoulder the burden of answering many questions on the same core topic.</p>

				<p>I don't think the "What are minimum specs for a MacBook to develop iOS apps? " question is answerable - you have picked a 2011 question and the answers then would not be correct now. One suggesting that a certain amount of RAM (depending on Xcode version) and then SSD rather than HDD for speed could be done</p>

				<p>@mark Great feedback - this is exactly what I had hoped to achieve. Many eyes making the selection / edits / choices here. Lets open a new meta question to discuss that point and link to it in the body of this answer. Once we have consensus, we can edit this post.</p>

				<p>For $PATH I think the answer in http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/121021/237 looks simplest and correct. For canonical status I think it needs to include terminal stating starts bash (explaining why the files are included) and possibly path_helper - However are there any other answers we could start from or should we create a new one?- Also we need a question how to set in GUI</p>

				<p>With the change in Sierra of the [Gatekeeper behaviour](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/243687/allow-applications-downloaded-from-anywhere-in-macos-sierra), it may be a good idea to turn one of those into a canonical question. Thoughts?</p>
