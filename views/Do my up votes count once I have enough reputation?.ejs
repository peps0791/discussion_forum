	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>I have a reputation of 11 at the moment, but I have found a couple a very useful questions and answers, things I would like to up vote. If I do so now, it does not show up, but I believe it is stored. Does the person who posted the question/answer received reputation once my reputation is high enough for an up vote to count? Or, do I need to remember where I placed these votes and revisit them once my reputation is high enough and vote again?</p>

		<p>Neither.</p>

<p>Anonymous feedback (positive and negative) is in a different bin and affects things like placement on the home page, search results, etc.. but it doesn't grant direct reputation.</p>

<p>You can look at this <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/whats-reputation">help section</a> to see how reputation works in specific.</p>
