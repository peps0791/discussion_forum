	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>Networking is very general and large, DHCP will narrow it much down. </p>

<p>As DHCP is a dynamically created range of IP which will be automatically assigned to a device.
Networking on the other hand is very large.</p>

<p>If a user decides to enter the Tag DHCP it will be a much easier subject to handle than just Networking.</p>

<p>I'll add an excerpt and other information if it can be done.</p>

<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>Personally I disagree with this, since every question tagged <em>dhcp</em> should be tagged <em>networking</em> anyway and if someone tags with <em>dhcp</em> but not <em>networking</em> then the question may be missed by those that are following the <em>networking</em> tag (this would mean that one would have to follow two tags) and would probably lead to the question being edited to add the <em>networking</em> tag.</p>
