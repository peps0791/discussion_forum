				<p><p>We have chosen for several years now to not be a place to host answers about beta and pre-release OS from Apple. </p>

<p>Until such time as consensus
changes, you should find support on Yosemite issues from the vendor or on another site. </p>

<p>See the FAQ for Yosemite in specific: <a href="https://appleseed.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/faq" rel="nofollow">https://appleseed.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/faq</a></p>

				<p>But for some weeks (?) Apple has changed its philosophy - everyone can now download the new Mac OS. It might be time to change this idea?</p>

				<p>@Martin - no as the answers change as they do a new release and as the answers will be outdated when they do the full release the only place with useful info is the vendor's forums - if you can't get info from there don't run the beta</p>

				<p>@Martin You could certainly open a new thread explaining how Apple's philosophy has changed (document if possible with specifics) or reply to the main question where the community has expressed a desire to not host these questions here. http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1712 and http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1331/</p>

				<p>@Martin and include in that change https://appleseed.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/faq "don t blog, post screen shots, tweet or publicly post information about the pre-release Apple software"</p>
