				<h2>Should questions about OS X Yosemite be allowed now it is in public beta?</h2>
<p>I know this question has already been asked, but with the public beta release everyone can access and get Yosemite. There will definitely be some bugs and glitches. Could we ask questions on Yosemite on the main site?</p>
