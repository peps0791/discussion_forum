				<h2>Some questions' titles not shown (Safari only)</h2>
<p>Sometimes I see a question that, when seen from the homepage, appears to have no title. You can still click its box and go to the question's page, where the title is visible.</p>

<p>In the below screencap, the effected question is #11664.</p>

<p>This isn't a problem from Chrome, but it is from WebKit nightly builds and Safari.</p>

				<p>I can't reproduce this. I'm using Safari 5.0.4 (5533.20.27) OSX.</p>

				<p>@Jin Figured out why. It's caused by an [extension](http://babelstudios.se/defacer/) I've got that hides Facebook 'Like' buttons on other sites. For some reason, it's giving that link a `display:none !important;`. So, I guess that makes it a problem on my end. Sorry for false alarm.</p>

				<p>@Jin given ^, should I just delete this question? I feel kinda silly for not looking into that kind of thing ahead of time...</p>
