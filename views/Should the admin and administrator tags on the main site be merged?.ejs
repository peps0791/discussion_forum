<ul>
<li><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/admin">admin</a> 28 uses (9 this year)</li>
<li><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/administrator">administrator</a> 14 uses (5 this year)</li>
</ul>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>I would say, let's first flush out what these tags mean to the site by having someone write a wiki summary for both tags (or at least propose what the tag <em>should</em> mean for the site in an answer here). Unless we have a good reason to keep them, let's just clean up the questions and let the nightly unused tag culling put them both out of their misery.</p>

<p>What sort of questions should be collected under <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/administrator">https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/administrator</a> and what sort of questions should be collected under <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/admin">https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/admin</a></p>

<p>It's not clear to me that we even need either of the tags and really we could edit the questions / merge them down to point to <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/windows">Windows</a> or <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/osx">OS X</a></p>

<p>We could merge and then clean up later as it appears both tags suffer from vague use patterns.</p>
