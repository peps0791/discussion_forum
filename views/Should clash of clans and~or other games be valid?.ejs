	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>I lately seen a lot of clash of clans and other games topics here. Should they be related to our topic of apple? I see the games as universal across all platforms (like android) and should not be related purely to apple and they should use another site. </p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>According to the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic">help center</a> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ask Different is for users of Apple products. If you have a question about ...</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>[...]</li>
  <li>third-party hardware, services and software when associated for use with Apple products.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>... then you're in the right place to ask your question!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so problems related to software running on Apple hardware are on-topic. Also a lot of these questions are related to the interaction between the game and Game Center which clearly is an Apple-related issues.</p>

<p>OTOH questions purely focusing on in-game issues are off-topic (but I haven't seen many of these here).</p>
