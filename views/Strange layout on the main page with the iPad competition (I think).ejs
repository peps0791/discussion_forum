				<h2>Strange layout on the main page with the iPad competition (I think)</h2>
<p>On the main page there appears to be some "additional content" and it looks as though it is related to an iPad.  However, I can't tell for sure because it looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/54SHr.png" alt="Main page view"></p>

<p>At first, I put it down to the fact that I'm using FF11 on Linux so clearly the "Ask Different" website would <em>Look Different</em> since no Apple products were harmed in the viewing of this page.</p>

<p>But then I happened to look at it using Safari Mobile on my iPad and it looked the same.</p>

<p>Is this how it ought to look?  There does appear to be something behind the main question bit - that black semi-circle is certainly suggestive of that fact.  Is the site telling me that I shouldn't use Firefox or Linux?</p>

				<p><p>This is intentional, the image is an iPad partially hiding behind the question view. If you click on the iPad you'll see that we're currently holding a contest, where the top contributors can earn iPads.</p>

				<p>Ah, I've now scrolled down a bit further and can see the bottom of the iPad.  I still say that that is completely non-obvious.  Is that the criteria for being in the competition - can you spot that it's an iPad?</p>

				<p>@AndrewStacey I'll admit that it does look like some sort of layout or formatting error to someone that doesn't recognize it, but I imagine most Apple fans will. If I were designing it I might have gone for something slightly different, but I think that it mostly does the job</p>

				<p>Yes, now that I know what it is then I recognise it.  I think it might have been better to go for a black iPad just because the main site is so white-dominated as it is.  I was really just trying to find out if there was something hidden that I wasn't seeing.  From what you say, I conclude that there isn't and so I'll stop worrying about it.  Thanks.</p>

				<p>@AndrewStacey We tried a black one first; it was way too harsh on the eyes (because of the extreme contrast with the rest of the site).</p>
