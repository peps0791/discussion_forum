				<h2>Inconvenient comment signature line break</h2>
<p>Due to the length of my name, it's often wrapped in comments. This is entirely understandable. However, it often gets wrapped like this:</p>

<pre><code>...[end of comment] -
Timothy Mueller-Harder
</code></pre>

<p>which looks really weird. I'm fine with</p>

<pre><code>...[end of comment] -Timothy
Mueller-Harder
</code></pre>

<p>as well as </p>

<pre><code>...[end of comment]
- Timothy Mueller-Harder
</code></pre>

<p>but wrapping between the hyphen and my first name is ridiculous. Please change this.</p>

<p>(Edit) Here's an example: <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SNBLU.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

				<p>If you are advocating that Stack Exchange removes the space between the end of the comment and the username, or linebreaks the dash ending the comment, I am 100% opposed to that.</p>

<p>This is standard browser line-wrapping behavior. When content hits the end of a displayed line, it rewinds to the last (non-breaking) space, and then moves all the content onto the next line.</p>

<p>You're just going to keep running into this problem.</p>

<p>So what can you do? My only suggestion is to change your username. The only three names I could think of that could permanently resolve this issue would be <code>Timothy-Mueller-Harder</code>, <code>TMH</code>, or <code>TM-H</code>. You could abbreviate it in some other fashion, such as <code>Timothy M-H</code>, but that won't fix the issue. You will inevitably post a comment of some length that pushes not only <code>M-H</code> onto the next line, but <code>Timothy</code> as well.</p>

				<p>The rendered HTML is already like you're proposing, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="/users/12285/timothy-mueller-harder"...
</code></pre>

<p>so this sounds like a browser issue.  Indeed, only Firefox seems to render the <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> correctly*:</p>
