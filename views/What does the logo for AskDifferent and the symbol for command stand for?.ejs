<p>Is it a flower? Indian symbol? I know that Jobs was a hippie in the 70s so maybe it comes from that times. Don't get me wrong, to me it looks like a svastika on steroids. But I am looking forward for some official meaning from you guys.</p>

				<p>The Apple ][ had an apple symbol for this key.  When Mac was being developed, and they added an apple menu to the GUI, it was thought that apple menu and apple key would be confused.  So they found another symbol (and name) for this key.</p>
