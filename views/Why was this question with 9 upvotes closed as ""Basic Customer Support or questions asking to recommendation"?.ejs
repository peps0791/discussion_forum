				<h2>Why was this question with 9 upvotes closed as ""Basic Customer Support or questions asking to recommendation"?</h2>
<p>I found out that the question <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/159833/20338">Equivalent of Dragon NaturallySpeaking&#39;s HeardWord function in Dragon Dictate 4</a> got closed two months ago (since no comment was left, I didn't receive any notification).</p>

<p>The question is clearly about Apple software, was upvoted 9 times, starred twice and had 300 views.</p>

<p>The mentioned reason is vague:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Basic Customer Support or questions asking to recommend or find off-site resources (Mac/book/software/tutorial) are off-topic for Ask Different as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam. Instead, edit to clearly describe your problem and the research done so far to solve it."   patrix</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question is clearly not about basic customer support (see number of upvotes and number of answers), and it is not asking for a recommendation.</p>

<p>So why was this question closed?</p>

<hr>

<p>Here was a copy of the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Title: Equivalent of Dragon NaturallySpeaking's HeardWord function in
  Dragon Dictate 4</p>
  
  <p>In Dragon NaturallySpeaking's Advanced Scripting Command on Windows,
  <a href="http://nuance.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/6141/~/using-the-heardword-function-in-advanced-scripting-commands" rel="nofollow noreferrer">HeardWord</a>
  is a function that enables Dragon NaturallySpeaking to behave as if
  the specified word, word sequence, or voice command was received by
  the recognizer. HeardWord can be used to create a command that
  executes a series of other commands, or that has the same function as
  an existing command but a different name.</p>
  
  <p>Here is an example to type a closing remark, in bold type, at the end
  of a document.</p>

<pre><code>HeardWord "go", "to", "bottom"
HeardWord "set", "font", "bold"
Wait 1
SendDragonKeys "{Enter 2}" + "This document was dictated using Dragon NaturallySpeaking."
</code></pre>
  
  <p>In <a href="http://www.nuance.com/for-individuals/by-product/dragon-for-mac/dragon-dictate/index.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Dragon Dictate
  4</a>,
  is there any way to write a voice command that calls other voice
  commands (e.g. a voice command that would call the built-in command
  "Cap")?</p>

				<p>Given Dragon is multi-platform and the question is about the software I think the question would be better suited for SuperUser.com -- there doesn't appear to be anything Apple-specific about the question.</p>

<p>I can migrate it if you'd like.</p>

				<p>I put the question on hold because it basically covers a topic which can (and IMHO) should be addressed to Dragon's support team (or forum) first.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2509/9058">this answer</a> to <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2508/why-were-not-customer-support-for-company-x-or-product-y?rq=1">Why we&#39;re not customer support for [company X or product Y]</a>:</p>

  <p><strong>We're not here to act as customer support on any company's behalf.</strong></p>
  
  <p>That's not our mission. We're here to help you learn how to interpret vague or conflicting behaviors once you've <strong>exhausted the normal support channels</strong> and <strong><em>documented that effort in your question</em></strong>. Your post here will live here for years - useful posts will drown amongst thousands of "help me please" posts with no detail and no effort to troubleshoot documented in them.</p>
