				<h2>Request for spam information</h2>
<p>I don't know if this is an appropriate question to ask here, but I thought this would be the best place to ask. I have noticed (especially recently) a LOT of spam questions (true spam, like for body-building products or magic ED fixes). I noticed three within the span of a few hours the other day and just flagged another one now. I feel like this site gets more than it should and more than the other site I'm on (photography).</p>

<p>So, my questions are:</p>

<p>1) Am I completely wrong in my assumption that there is way too much spam, or have others noticed it too?</p>

<p>2) Is there anything that can be done to prevent spam questions like these from ever being posted?</p>

				<p>Yeah, for whatever reason spammers tend to become attached to specific sites. AD happens to be a lucky winner:</p>

<p><sup>Detected spam over the last month</sup></p>

<p>The system has some clever logic in place to block quite a bit of this... but there's a ton coming in anyway, so some will get through. There's also a <a href="https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/SmokeDetector" rel="nofollow noreferrer">community project</a> that does <a href="https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/graphs" rel="nofollow noreferrer">rather well</a>.</p>

				<p>This site does get more than  it's fair share of spam at the moment, considering it's size and it's increased of late:.</p>

<p>I'm noticing the more popular programming sites tend to get more. And I think spammers see Apple and think - <em>let's go</em> Now that last bit is my opinion as to why.</p>

<p><a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/11540/charcoal-hq">Charcoal HQ</a> monitors spam that makes it to the sites. I got these charts courtesy of the metasmoke stats, used in Charcoal HQ. Any spam reported in Charcoal gets deleted with flags. The more people active in the room at the time, the quicker it is deleted.</p>

				<p>I really wish there was a one-vote ban-hammer on these - maybe like the gold badge one-vote close.</p>

<p>Maybe you could gain a spam-hammer badge after successfully flagging 100 with no false positives, or an ability added to users over <em>x</em> rep [perhaps with a review queue after the fact, to make sure it's not being mis-used]</p>

				<p>The most powerful tool we have for immediate use is for everyone to flag as spam on those posts. That ensures the best improvement on the tools to detect and suppress spam. </p>

<p>You are right. The past month here has more spam than possibly 10 months before. We the elected moderators sincerely thank you all for flagging these ham fisted spam posts so we can get them deleted from view. </p>

<p><em>Here is a search that lets moderators search for the posts fitting his pattern - <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?tab=newest&amp;q=deleted%3a1%20locked%3a1%20migrated%3ano_">https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?tab=newest&amp;q=deleted%3a1%20locked%3a1%20migrated%3ano</em></a></p>

<p><em>10k users can see deleted posts - once they get the link. Currently, 10k users can only search for their deleted posts - not anyone's posts.</em></p>
