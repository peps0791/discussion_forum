				<h2>How to appeal a question's status as exact duplicate?</h2>
<p>My question was closed as an exact duplicate; however, I don't think it is, since my question addresses a more specific capability of the iOS keyboard in terms of Unicode (not just symbols).</p>

<p>So I'd like to know how, if possible, I might appeal a moderator's decision to mark it as exact duplicate? Is there a way I can contact the moderator?</p>

				<p>The best way is to edit your post so that it's clear that it's not a duplicate, then flag it for moderator attention asking for us to take another look.</p>

<p>In any case, based on what you've said, I've edited your title and reopened your question.</p>
