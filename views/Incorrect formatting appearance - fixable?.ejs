				<h2>Incorrect formatting appearance - fixable?</h2>
<p>My first post on Meta &amp; I didn't find anything similar by searching...<br>
I see this a lot, on various question/answers - the last line of a code section hidden behind the scroll-bar...</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9acCk.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>If I check Edit, there is no fault with the user's formatting, they have added lines underneath [&amp; incidentally if I then Cancel the formatting 'fixes' itself]</p>

<p>Is there a 'higher-up' who could have a look at this &amp; fix it?</p>

<p>My System - Early 08 Mac Pro; 10.9.4, 26GB RAM, SSD, Safari 7.0.5</p>

<p>Link to this specific example - <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/143649/services-menu-shows-the-incorrect-name">Services menu shows the incorrect name</a></p>

<p>Further testing - Chrome shows it just fine, Safari does if I refresh the page, but consistently fails on first opening of that link. I really have no special kind of setup in Safari, it's pretty much fresh out the box in terms of how I have it configured.</p>

				<p>Can you link to the question so we can see the issue - it has probably something to do with your browser setup</p>

				<p>Sure - wasn't sure I could find it again, but I did..</p>

				<p>Looks OK on my Safari OSX 10.9.4</p>

				<p>Hmm... it works if I simply click the link, fails if I Cmd/Shift/Click to open in new tab, which is my default method for forum browsing.</p>

				<p>The latter i.e. right click is how I opened it</p>

				<p>Stranger still - right click open in new tab fails, open in new window works.</p>

				<p>Can but hope - it's not hugely irritating, tbh, I'll survive ;-)</p>

				<p>works ok here with 7.0.5 and right-clicking to new tab. Maybe you've installed an extension which impacts rendering?</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-4200" class = "comment">
				<p>You appear to be correct - BOTH Click to Flash & YouTube5 do it, if either is enabled, I see the error, both disabled I don't.</p>
