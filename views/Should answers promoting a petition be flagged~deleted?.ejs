<p>The following answer was posted as an answer to <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/124937/iphone-4s-grayed-out-wi-fi-and-bug-report-exists-for-it">this question</a>:</p>

<pre><code>This is an old problem, that Apple doesn't really care about. So sadly, we need to make
some noise to be listened and have our problems solved. This is a petition, please read

<p>Are answers such as this worthy of being flagged NAA and deleted?</p>

				<p><p>It doesn't answer the question so flagging/deleting definitively is in order. In this case it does have some merits as a comment. </p>

				<p><p>I would say the mentioning of a petition isn't the reason to delete a post. It's when there's no answer to be seen and all the post does is petition / advertise. Just like spam solicitations are out of bounds, spam solicitations are similarly not primarily in the interest of collecting knowledge and solving an issue as opposed to raising awareness of a project, effort or tool.</p>

<p>I would say a post like that clearly could be edited into shape, so a down vote, a comment, an edit would all be great initial actions rather than needing a moderator to step in and delete. <em>(However, no one is under obligation to step in and save a post that could be saved, just pointing out the possibility.)</em></p>

<p>Of course we can and should delete posts that clearly are not an answer as the linked item as posted is. I also wanted to encourage people to try to save posts by new users rather than just writing them off for deletion rather than exhausting the normal means to moderate a post.</p>
