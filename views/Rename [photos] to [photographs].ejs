<p><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/photos" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;photos&#39;" rel="tag">photos</a> is ambiguous, as people may think it refers to the photos OS X application.</p>

<p>It should be renamed to <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/photographs" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;photographs&#39;" rel="tag">photographs</a> to avoid ambiguity.</p>

<p>There was a previous request to change it as an answer by the OP of <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2455/synonym-for-photos-app-to-photos">Synonym for photos.app to photos</a> , but underneath that answer was a comment suggesting using the tag chat room (now frozen) or another question to discuss it.</p>
