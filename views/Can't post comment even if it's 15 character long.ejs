<p>Please indicate me if i am doing any thing wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> It's not accepting "@Greg Cain: Greater!!!!!" even, which include 15 alphabets.</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>It's not considering the @-reference as part of the comment. Not to mention that after clicking submit, the @-reference to Greg's username is going to be stripped out. Since you're commenting on his answer, explicitly referencing the OP is unnecessary as they will be notified of a new comment on their answer.</p>

<p>While the gesture of thanking the user in words is appreciated, voting has a more tangible effect. Give the up-vote a click and/or accept his answer, and call it done.</p>
