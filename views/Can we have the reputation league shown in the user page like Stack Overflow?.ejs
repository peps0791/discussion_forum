				<h2>Can we have the reputation league shown in the user page like Stack Overflow?</h2>
<p>Having been participating on Stack Overflow a bit recently, I've noticed this:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/H6GWh.png" width="498"></p>

<p>This doesn't seem to exist on Ask Different:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nxvaX.png" width="468"></p>

<p>Can it be added?</p>

				<p>Good question, is it because SO is a bit bigger? If you check http://stackexchange.com/sites you can see SO is (according to the image) 4 times bigger than AskDifferent.</p>

				<p>@Robuust Yeah, but why does that mean that the statistic isn't shown here?</p>

				<p>I have no idea, I'd like to see it too. But that was my point - maybe it's still in beta on SO? I don't know? Just guessing along with you.</p>

				<p><p>It seems only SO shows the rep. league.</p>

<p>Since SE has 115(!) Q&amp;A sites all in all, I made a script (obviously :P) to look through each of them and check whether profile pages showed rep. league.</p>

<p>The result was that no other SE sites but SO showed it. To be extra sure, I also recorded total number of users for each site <em>and</em> number of users with actual RP change. And thus, I don't think it has anything to do with community size.</p>

<p>Just to give you an idea of community sizes on SE:</p>

<ul>
<li>SO has ~2.85 mill.</li>
<li>Ask Ubuntu has ~181k</li>
<li>Ask Different has ~54k</li>
<li>Homebrew has 3.6k</li>
<li>Italian has 445</li>
</ul>

<p>So maybe the SE devs are just trying it out on their largest site? Doesn't seem to be by mistake that it only shows on SO.</p>

				<p>Showing too precise precision i.e. that should make more sense as ).2% and mine should be 1% rather than .98%</p>

			<div id = "comment-4107" class = "comment">
				<p>@Mark I guess it's using the same code as SO/etc where 0.01% is a fair few spots on the leaderboard.</p>

				<p>SO seems to be rounded to 1 significant figure e.g. 2% which is why I noticed</p>
