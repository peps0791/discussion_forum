				<h2>Plural vs. Singular and Infinitive vs. Name tags</h2>
<p>I see there are several tags that are in a plural form but the singular form would also be acceptable and vice-versa, for examples :</p>

<ul>
<li>software</li>
<li>shortcuts</li>
<li>applications</li>
<li>settings</li>
<li>bookmark</li>
</ul>

<p>There is the same <em>problem</em> for infinitive verbs and the name derivates from this verb :</p>

<ul>
<li>printing</li>
<li>networking</li>
<li>charging</li>
<li>mapping</li>
<li>sharing</li>
</ul>

<p>As a guideline for the creation of new tags (and why not also edit the current ones) : </p>

<h2>Do tags have to be in a plural or singular form ?</h2>

<p>and</p>

<h2>Do tags have to be in an infinitive verb or an -ing name ?</h2>

				<p>Is there an issue with <code>[printing]</code>? I would default to looking at <a href="https://superuser.com/tags">superusers tags</a> to see which seems to be the "correct" tag for this. </p>

<p>Overall I don't think that tags <strong>must</strong> be plural / singular or infinitive as a <em>general</em> rule. If you see something tagged <code>[share]</code> it should probably be <code>[sharing]</code> though.</p>

				<p>About <strong>singular vs plural</strong> in cases where both make sense; for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>app(s)</li>
<li>shortcut(s)</li>
<li>podcast(s)</li>
<li>accessor(y/ies)</li>
<li>monitor(s)</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd say <strong>plural</strong> is good, and that seems to be currently preferred in most cases. However: two observations:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/tags">top tags</a> there aren't that many cases where both make sense. (Quickly I found just <code>monitor</code> and <code>passwords</code> that maybe should be batch-retagged to plural.)</li>
<li>We shouldn't get too hung-up with such rule; rather, use what seems the most natural case-by-case. </li>
</ol>

<p>For the record, plural is what we went with <a href="https://english.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/72/should-we-prefer-singular-or-plural-in-tags">over at English language &amp; usage</a> (where this affects more tags than here). </p>
