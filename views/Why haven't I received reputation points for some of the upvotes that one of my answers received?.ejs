Am I misunderstanding some portion of the process or the rules?</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>Your linked answer is a community wiki post. One of the effects of this is that  you receive no reputation for the post, positive or negative. This is indicated by the different style of author link at the bottom of the post.</p>

<p>Answers can be made community wiki specifically using the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/community-wiki">community wiki checkbox under the answer once you reach 10 reputation</a>, however in this case the answer was automatically converted to community wiki as the question is community wiki. There are extremely few community wiki questions on the site (0.12% of questions are community wiki at the moment).</p>

<p>There is no bug, this is <a href="/questions/tagged/status-bydesign" class="post-tag moderator-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;status-bydesign&#39;" rel="tag">status-bydesign</a>. For more information about community wiki, see:</p>
