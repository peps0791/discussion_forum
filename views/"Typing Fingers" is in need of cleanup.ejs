				<h2>"Typing Fingers" is in need of cleanup</h2>
<p>I found a question here that needs cleanup when I was reviewing.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/90066/app-or-webapp-for-learning-touch-type-on-ios-with-apple-wireless-keyboard">https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/90066/app-or-webapp-for-learning-touch-type-on-ios-with-apple-wireless-keyboard</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It got protected by Community about 3 minutes before I posted this question. It contains a surprising amount of answers in the shape of "This app is good. I tried it" that the answer thread now looks like a chat room.</p>
