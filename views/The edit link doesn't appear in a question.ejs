This behavior is not the same I note in other Q&amp;A sites where I don't have the privilege of editing posts.</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>Anonymous users are limited to suggesting edits for posts more than 8 hours old.</p>

<p>As a registered user with &lt; 2000 rep you should be able to suggest edits on any post, provided </p>

<ul>
<li>the suggested edit queue is not full.</li>
<li>the post does not already have a suggested edit.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am guessing it was #2</p>
