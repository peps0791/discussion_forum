				<h2>Please update the Markdown help to include how to enter keyboard symbols</h2>
<p>The how-to and copy-and-paste codes for entering keyboard symbols is <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/26207/how-can-i-format-as-keyboard-keys">scattered</a> <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/193/21703">around</a> AD <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/210/21703">meta</a> but it is something that comes up a lot and is very helpful, particularly when using an iPad. </p>

<p>Can we please get these answers consolidated and added to the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/editing-help">full page Markdown help</a>?  If not the full info itself, then at least links to it, like was done for <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/1777/183358">inline HTML</a>.  </p>

<p>I know that technically <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> is HTML but obviously not a lot of people know it, so just using it as an example of inline HTML is not enough. </p>

				<p>I don't think that a <em>Markdown</em> help page is an appropriate place for teaching users about HTML tags, however obscure they may be.</p>

<p>I see three options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't provide a Markdown help page. Provide an <em>editing</em> help page that covers both Markdown and HTML.</li>
<li>Provide a discoverable <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/390/editor-button-or-shortcut-for-kbd-tag">editor button</a> for inserting the <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code> tag.</li>
<li>Polish and link more prominently to an <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1777/what-html-tags-are-allowed-on-stack-exchange-sites">HTML help page</a>.</li>
</ul>
