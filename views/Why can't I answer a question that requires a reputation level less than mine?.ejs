				<p><p>The rep you earned linking your SE account doesn't count, unfortunately. You need to earn 10 rep points <em>on Ask Different organically</em> to be able to answer that question. You can get those points through voting, answering non-protected questions, asking questions, editing posts, etc.</p>

				<p>Thanks Ian. I didn't realize (or remember) that those points were from linking accounts. I also don't think the difference was made clear in the notice or the "reputation" link. Might be an opportunity to improve the site.</p>

				<p>I agree. We'll look into editing the site text to make it clearer.</p>
