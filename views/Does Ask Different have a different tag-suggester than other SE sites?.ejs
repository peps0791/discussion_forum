	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>I m using an old version of IOS Safari (original iPad).  Of course, there a lot of minor irritations with the UI.  One of them is that on all SE sites, selecting a suggested tag takes anywhere from two taps to more than I m willing to retry.</p>

<p>Except here.  Here,  it just works. </p>

<p>Is it different JavaScript?<br>

Sigh.  Never mind.  Until now, I selected a tag with one tap every time in the site only.  This time, I gave up after ten taps.</p>
