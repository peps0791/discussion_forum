				<h2>What to do about a particular Spam Only user</h2>
<p>I noticed this morning that a new user, <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/85896/">user85896</a>, which was created "today", has posted three answers that are obviously spam and one that I flagged as link-only, which should probably have been spam as well.</p>

<p>I don't have the rep to do anything about this, but I'm posting it here so someone with a decent amount of rep can take the appropriate action, if it is warranted.</p>

			</div><h3>Comments</h3>
				<input type = 'text'/>
				<input type = 'button' value = 'Comment'/><br>
				<button class="record-start" id="start-2184">Record</button>
				<button class="record-stop" id="stop-2184">Stop</button>
				<p id="recording-2184"></p>

				<p>Thanks for the confirmation. I wasn't sure if this was the correct thing to do or if there was some other way I should handle it.</p>

				<p>A meta post will work, but generally speaking, since obvious spam doesn't really need a lot of meta discussion, 'flagging' the post would have a more effective way of letting someone know in a timely manner. Regards.</p>
