<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>Nothing can be done, although you can downvote the answer (and either answer with the correct answer, providing some reference to the accepted answer, or comment underneath the accepted answer).</p>

<p>Mods cannot override, remove, or nominate accepted answers, only the OP can do that.</p>


<p>"Accepted" basically means that the asker was happy with the answer (which doesn't necessarily mean it's correct). Usually votes are a better indicator on answer quality/correctness because more eyeballs are involved. So if you run into such a situation you can</p>

<ul>
<li>downvote wrong answers (even if they are accepted)</li>
<li>upvote correct answers (or provide the correct answer if it is missing)</li>
<li>add a comment to the question (so the asker gets notified) or the wrongly accepted answer (referencing the asker with @xyz)</li>
</ul>
