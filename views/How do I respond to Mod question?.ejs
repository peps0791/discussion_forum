	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>I flagged <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/272082/88313">an answer</a> as abusive because of the derogatory language the author used to reference another user (the answer has since been edited but you can see the original text in the edit history).  I was using <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/58032/what-are-the-spam-and-rude-or-abusive-offensive-flags-and-how-do-they-wor/58035#58035">this post</a> as my guide for what constitutes 'abuse'.</p>

<p>The flag reviewer responded with a question to me:
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hoDQi.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/hoDQi.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>I don't want the reviewer to think I'm an idiot and I want them to know why I flagged it as I did (I don't want to argue that it was declined, that's within their right).</p>

<p>How do I respond and answer the question?</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>Basically flags are for things where the normal tools cannot fix the issue. In this case, an edit handled it which is why the flag was declined. </p>

<p>Keep in mind, when we review flags we see the current post and not the original. The behavior was both rude and offensive so I've suspended the account in question temporarily. </p>
