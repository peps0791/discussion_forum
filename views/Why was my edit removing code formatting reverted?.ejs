				<h2>Why was my edit removing code formatting reverted?</h2>
<p>I recently made <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/revisions/171874/2">an edit</a> to this answer:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/171863/apple-mail-keeps-crashing-frequently-after-ram-problem/171874#171874">Apple Mail keeps crashing frequently after RAM problem</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I removed the code formatting from the text, except the shell commands as these are code.</p>

<p>My edit was then <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/171874/revisions">reverted</a>. Given that I make hundreds of edits across SE of this type, and this is the first time I've had one reverted that I can recall, I do want to understand why this occurred given that no custom edit summary was provided.</p>

<p>Code formatting misuse has been discussed <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2197/markup-of-reserved-words/2199#2199">here before</a>, yet nothing was said to the contrary at the time; of course, Meta.SE has many discussions on this topic which I linked to in the aforementioned answer.</p>

<p>Why was my edit rolled back?</p>

				<p>The edit was purely for formatting and IMO didn't make it significantly better. Secondly, the author of the post disagreed with the specific edit.</p>

<p>That's two strikes, so a moderator rolled back the edit.</p>

<p>Editing is one of the aspects that include multiple guidelines which are often at conflict. I get it's a pet peeve to "mis use" certain formatting items, but if you print the original answer out on paper, or look at it in any standard web browser - it's in no way unclear or unuseful.</p>

<p>You are correct that standard formatting is asked for in [help] but there's also an aspect of allowing the original poster to have a little more weight in things that are style as opposed to substance in many cases.</p>

<p>Guidelines:</p>

<ol>
<li>The OP used valid markdown - <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/formatting">https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/formatting</a></li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/editing">Editing Guidelines</a>:</p>

<p>Edits are expected to be substantial and to leave the post better than you found it. Common reasons for edits include:</p>

<ul>
<li>To fix grammar and spelling mistakes</li>
<li>To clarify the meaning of the post (without changing that meaning)</li>
<li>To include additional information only found in comments, so all of the information relevant to the post is contained in one place</li>
<li>To correct minor mistakes or add updates as the post ages</li>
<li>To add related resources or hyperlinks</li>
</ul>

<p>Clearly, substantial is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWdd6_ZxX8c" rel="nofollow noreferrer">matter of opinion</a> in many cases. Basically, When I reviewed the post after you asked on meta, I saw George's edits as failing to meet any of these criteria. I understand many feel that using "code blocks" is a "mistake" however, when you point that out to the OP and they say they intentionally formatted it that way - we're not into opinion and judgement.</p>

<p>If you wish to make a second answer with the formatting of your choice, that might be the best avenue if you really feel the post <strong>needs</strong> correcting and if you comment and the OP declines your help with the edit. In that case, the moderation will arrange a chat room for the editor and the OP to discuss things in hopes of coming to a mutual agreement. Only if that fails would a moderator step in and perhaps lock the post in one state.</p>

<p>We're not there - we're just at the "one edit was made and then rolled back" stage.</p>

<p>Thanks for all the comments and down votes - it's nice knowing that people really care about the small things. I ask that everyone keep "the big picture" in mind - the site exists to allow great answers. Why antagonize one poster with minutia like changing their emphasis style when nothing else is wrong with their answer and a ton of things are right with the answer.</p>
