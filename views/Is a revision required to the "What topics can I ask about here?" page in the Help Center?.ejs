				<h2>Is a revision required to the "What topics can I ask about here?" page in the Help Center?</h2>
<p>In the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic">What topics can I ask about here?</a> page it clearly states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ask Different is for <strong>users of Apple products</strong>. If you have a
  question about ...</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Apple hardware</li>
  <li>Apple software</li>
  <li>Apple services including iTunes Connect (selling music, books, apps)</li>
  <li>third-party hardware, services and software when associated for use with Apple products.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>... then you're in the right place to ask your question!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recently <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/5472/bmike">bmike</a> corrected me because I had assumed a question about a formula in Excel was off-topic. I accepted his correction (obviously, as a moderator with the highest reputation I wasn't going to think he was wrong!), but since then I've seen a number of instances where users have voted to close questions as off-topic because the questions were about third-party software.</p>

<p>This got me to thinking that perhaps the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic">What topics can I ask about here?</a> page could do with some minor revision. It may be something as simple as a formatting change to bold the words "third-party hardware, services and software" in the last bullet point.</p>

<p>What do others think?</p>

				<p>Whiuch questions were closed - I would also not the off topic condition - Basic Customer Support - so can be a matter of opinion which of the two criteria apply.</p>

				<p>I'm not sure the questions were actually closed, just that there were people voting for them to be closed. But I do agree that it often comes down to a matter of opinion in terms of what category applies.</p>

				<p><p>Well, somebody using Excel on macOS <strong>is</strong> a user of an Apple product, and the bullet list makes it rather clear what a question can be about. I partially understand your confusion, but IMHO the wording is rather clear.</p>

				<p>I agree the wording **is** clear, but in the past week I've seen a few questions users have voted to close on the basis they were off-topic when, based on the last bullet point, they aren't. I think the last bullet point is a little lost, not only because it's the last one, but because the first three start with the word _Apple_ which stands out because it's 'Apple' and because of the capital 'A'. Also, the stem sentence has _users of Apple products_ in **bold**. I guess others will learn that these questions are on-topic, but I just thought a minor formatting change may reduce confusion.</p>

				<p>Yeah, but then we would kind of need all bullets in bold, somehow.</p>
