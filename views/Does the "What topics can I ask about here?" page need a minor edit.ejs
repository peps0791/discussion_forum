	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>I feel the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic">What topics can I ask about here?</a> page needs a minor edit. At present, this page still contains a link to the no-longer active blog (see screenshot below):</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6zNXJ.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6zNXJ.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>While linking to the blog itself is not necessarily a problem, I do feel it is a problem <em>within</em> this context. The reason being that the whole purpose of this paragraph is to help users understand the Q&amp;A setting of Ask Different is best suited to questions about practical problems, rather than to <em>discussion</em> type questions. It then refers users to the chat room and blog if they have an opinion-based post (at least that's how I'm interpreting it).</p>

<p>I propose we remove the link so that this sentence now reads:</p>

<p><em>We do have a <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com">chat room</a> for opinion-based posts.</em></p>

<p>Or, something similar to the above.</p>
