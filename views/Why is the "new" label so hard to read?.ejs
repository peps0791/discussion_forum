	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>I suspect some CSS rule is being incorrectly applied to the "new" feature notifier.</p>

<p>I'm talking about the "new" block that appears when a new navigation or other site element is added. It showed up most recently on the main site when the blog link was added.</p>

<p>The e is nearly solid, and the rest of the text just looks... off. Any ideas why?</p>

<p>Additionally, as provided by @stuffe, As well as being blocky, it's not aligned to the text baseline.</p>
