				<h2>Why is the "new" label so hard to read?</h2>
<p>I suspect some CSS rule is being incorrectly applied to the "new" feature notifier.</p>

<p>I'm talking about the "new" block that appears when a new navigation or other site element is added. It showed up most recently on the main site when the blog link was added.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NSkNu.png" alt="It&#39;s NEW!"></p>

<p>The e is nearly solid, and the rest of the text just looks... off. Any ideas why?</p>

<p>Additionally, as provided by @stuffe, As well as being blocky, it's not aligned to the text baseline.</p>

				<p>I suspect that this question made Jeff realize that the link was not here on meta, since it's suddenly here, and "new"! Which was not the case last night when I wrote this up.</p>

				<p>I found that removing the CSS shadow on that text helps. http://i.imgur.com/b8qij.png</p>

				<p>I figured that might be the case. Definitely looks much more readable.</p>
