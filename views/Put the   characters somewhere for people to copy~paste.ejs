<p>It would be easy and useful to put the most-commonly-used keyboard shortcut characters (such as  , and perhaps others   see <a href="http://pastie.org/4011" rel="nofollow">here</a> for a list, which you can also place at <code>~/Library/Key Bindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict</code> to type these characters easily) somewhere on the page (perhaps in the editing help, or discreetly in the footer?) so people could copy and paste them when writing questions/answers if they don't have an easy way to type them.</p>

				<p>I would love some implementations of this but only if it was clutter free.</p>

<p>To avoid overload, perhaps only the symbols that appear as menu items of major apps would be available?</p>

<p>The menu bar uses these icons respectively - so it's clear users might need these</p>

<ul>
<li>Finder:            </li>
<li>Safari: adds two more   and   </li>
</ul>

<p>I'd leave all the rest out - although a strong case can be made for eject and power symbols since every mac has one or the other in the top right. </p>

<p>The list of icons you made is too large for my taste - but I'd rather have too much than nothing at all. Lion does make the special characters feature very easy - but not all our users are on that OS. I can't speak for Linux or Windows users as I don't know how easy the tools for clipping are. I do know that the iPad isn't as easy as you have to either enable the emoji board or bookmark a web app like <a href="http://mrgan.com/gb/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">GlyphBoard</a> and multitask /copy / multitask/ paste your way into these characters.</p>

<p>The Markdown Editing Help menu seems an ideal implementation of this. <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zAoy8.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>It could ride the coattails of that UI to begin with. It should be fairly trivial to add in a table to the right of HTML - to the left of "advanced help" and drop in a small table that educates users of the current icons in use here.</p>

<p>You could place a few characters in the normal drop down - and have a fuller set when you are in the help mode - just like you get basic lists from the toolbar icon, but get advanced nesting help when you look at it with the markdown overlay. </p>

				<p>I've put them into characters' favorites table. They are accessible to me in any app via <br><kbd> </kbd>+<kbd> </kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>.</p>

<p>And yes, I did copy those symbols to the <strong>clipboard</strong> by double-clicking on them.</p>

				<p>I'm in the unfortunate situation of sometimes having to read this site running IE8 on a computer at work when I'm on break. While this post solves the copy/paste problem when I'm away from my Mac, unfortunately, many of the aforementioned characters are just rectangular boxes on my work machine.</p>

<p>So perhaps this solution of a copy/paste list will help iPad users, but the special characters are already reasonable accessible on a Mac (but this does make them a little easier to use), and unreadable in some Windows setups, so this solution might be less universally helpful than I might wish it were. Alas.</p>

				<p>You can actually copy them from <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/193/keyboard-icons-terminology">this meta post by Dori</a>. She put all the icons, names, and HTML entities into one post. You can just search the post with <kbd>Command  </kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd>.</p>

<p>In response to bmike's comment below, this actually will work for those on an iOS device because the meta post above includes HTML entities. While this isn't preferable, it <em>is</em> better than not having them at all.</p>

				<p>I like to use the widget:</p>

<h1><a href="https://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/reference/characterpal.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">CharacterPal</a></h1>

<p>This is the fastest way I know of to find and copy needed characters.</p>
