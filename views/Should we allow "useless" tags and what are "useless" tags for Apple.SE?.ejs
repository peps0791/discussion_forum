				<h2>Should we allow "useless" tags and what are "useless" tags for Apple.SE?</h2>
<p>What is the list of tags we should not allow? Much like how on most other SE sites tags like <code>homework</code>, <code>subjective</code>, etc. have been disallowed.</p>

<p>For more info check out: <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/51627/should-we-permanently-remove-the-subjective-tag">Should we permanently remove the [subjective] tag?</a> on Meta.SO.</p>

				<p>Why should we not allow <code>[mac]</code> or <code>[apple]</code> tags? </p>

<p>Is there a distinct clutter benefit to not allowing them? </p>

<p>Some tags that I think we should not allow:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>[linux]</code></li>
<li><code>[windows]</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, just a joke. I can't think of any tags that <em>shouldn't</em> be allowed, except for standard subjective questions, questions that are clearly argumentative (<code>windows-vs-mac</code>?) or spiteful (<code>i-can't-google</code>).</p>

				<p>At first I believed they'd add clutter but using <code>[mac]</code> for any Mac based questions, <code>[iphone]</code> for iPhone based questions, etc. will help users categorize the type of Apple question. My initial impressions was wrong but I still believe there will be a list of tags that should not be allowed. The ones I first gave are not them.</p>

				<p>I think that if we have an <code>[apple]</code> tag, it will be used in a way that doesn't add any value.  Maybe we can use <code>[apple inc]</code> for questions related to the company.</p>

				<p>[Mac] strikes me as the single most superfluous tag. [OSX] while seemingly useless at a glance, is actually fairly useful for categorizing general system software questions that aren't specific to one version or another. Similarly, [Apple] makes perfect sense as a tag for questions about Apple, The Company, rather than Apple, The Subject - But if folks would rather that tag be [Apple, Inc.], I don't think that's a problem either.</p>

<p>Questions about Mac Hardware, should, for clarity, probably be tagged with the particular product line (i.e. [iMac], [PowerBook], [Mac Mini]), or category ([Notebook], [Desktop]). I can really only count on one hand the sort of questions that could generally be applied to all Macs across that sort of categorization scheme that would actually benefit from a tag of [Mac] and not something else entirely.</p>
