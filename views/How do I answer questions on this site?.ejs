				<h2>How do I answer questions on this site?</h2>
<p>I found a solution to <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/55243/the-headphone-jack-on-my-macbook-pro-just-stopped-working-how-do-i-fix-it">a question on this site</a> that no one had provided my answer for and I wanted to share it with the world.  I cannot figure out how to answer a question.  Commenting takes "Reputation".  How do I do this?  I love this site idea but I am very frustrated right now.</p>

				<p>The question you've mentioned (<a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/55243/the-headphone-jack-on-my-macbook-pro-just-stopped-working-how-do-i-fix-it">The headphone jack on my MacBook Pro just stopped working. How do I fix it?</a>) got protected automatically by the system because it attracted a lot of off-topic answers in the past (which got deleted so you can't see them). I've removed the protection and am looking forward to see your answer.</p>
