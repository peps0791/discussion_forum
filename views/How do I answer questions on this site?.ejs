				<h2>How do I answer questions on this site?</h2>
<p>I found a solution to <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/55243/the-headphone-jack-on-my-macbook-pro-just-stopped-working-how-do-i-fix-it">a question on this site</a> that no one had provided my answer for and I wanted to share it with the world.  I cannot figure out how to answer a question.  Commenting takes "Reputation".  How do I do this?  I love this site idea but I am very frustrated right now.</p>

				<p>As you see - 18 hours only have passed since this question & already you have over 50 rep points. The entry bar is there to stop fly-bys & spammers, not people who wish to actively participate. It doesn't take long to get that first 50 - now not only can you answer, you can comment on other people's posts too. Welcome to Ask Different ! :)</p>

				<p><p>You can answer the vast majority of site questions without earning 10 reputation on a specific site. An association bonus of 100 doesn't count in the few questions that are "protected".</p>

<p>Anyone with 10 rep (association or earned otherwise can comment on anyone's questions or answers. </p>

				<p>Then I was going to just post the question and answer it myself, but I found out that you can only post every 20min... Thanks for your help.  I don't if you work for this site, but if you do, you should know this is a very unwelcome way for people to contribute.  I don't how the site can function when there are road blocks the whole way to building it up</p>

				<p>Very few people 'work for this site'. The entire idea of SE is that it is edited & moderated by the users themselves, gaining powers with reputation, plus we have dedicated moderators, who have higher edit/delete powers.</p>

				<p>@AaronTrimble extenuating circumstances -- the vast majority of our questions here don't have such a high bar on them for answering. The one you picked just happens to be a magnet for bad and off topic answers so it was protected.</p>

				<h2>Answer</h2>
				<h3>Score ::4</h3>
				<p><p>The question you've mentioned (<a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/55243/the-headphone-jack-on-my-macbook-pro-just-stopped-working-how-do-i-fix-it">The headphone jack on my MacBook Pro just stopped working. How do I fix it?</a>) got protected automatically by the system because it attracted a lot of off-topic answers in the past (which got deleted so you can't see them). I've removed the protection and am looking forward to see your answer.</p>
