				<h2>Policy~opinion on upvoting a question</h2>
<p>Sorry for the ambiguous title.</p>

<p>Better but more wordy question ought to be...<br>
Is it policy or does it make sense to upvote a question where the user obviously did something incredibly dim, but the question/answer itself could be useful to other people?</p>

<p>I use this as an example [the fact that I answered it has no bearing, I'm still tempted to upvote the question as useful]<br>

				<p>From the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/why-vote">FAQ on Why is voting important</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Voting up a question or answer signals to the rest of the community that a post is interesting, well-researched, and useful, while voting down a post signals the opposite: that the post contains wrong information, is poorly researched, or fails to communicate information. The more that people vote on a post, the more certain future visitors can be of the quality of information contained within that post   not to mention that upvotes are a great way to thank the author of a good post for the time and effort put into writing it!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the key idea is not to vote on the actions/problems of others but primarily on whether a question is "interesting, well-researched, and useful". Which also means that down voted questions can have up voted answers (and vice versa, which is probably the case more often).</p>

<p>But also keep in mind that the SE network is all about sharing information and giving back to the community. So if you see ways to improve a question, go ahead and do so because it will benefit all parties involved (the OP might learn how to write better questions, you will get some reputation for the edit and the community has a better question attracting better answers).</p>
