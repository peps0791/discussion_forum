				<h2>Was my question deleted?</h2>
<p>I asked a question some time ago about dismissing multiple notifications on OS X. I still have the issue, but my question appears to have been deleted.</p>

<p>It's not showing on my recently deleted questions list - I guess it was probably deleted some time ago as well.</p>

<p>Does it still exist somewhere? Can anyone tell if/why it was deleted? I know I did get a couple of "random" downvotes at one point, so it may have been at -1 - would that, combined with low activity, have been sufficient for it to have been automatically deleted at some point?</p>

<p>EDIT: Here's what I see when I follow <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2830/51900">@bmike's</a> link</p>
