				<h2>Is there a way to rescind a close vote?</h2>
<p>I voted to close <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/64468/what-hidden-features-have-you-found-in-ios-6">this</a> question earlier today because I didn't realize iOS 6 had been released. I have since realized that I'm an idiot and should check things before blithely voting to close a perfectly fine question for a reason that no longer applies.</p>

<p>So: I'd like to rescind my close vote. Is there a way to do this? If there isn't, can one be added?</p>

				<p>With respect to that question, I'm not ready to close it as a binding vote, but feel it would be more useful to the site with one answer that was CW like [this example](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/23577/how-many-genius-mixes-are-there-in-itunes) If you read my edit notes on the question I describe some of what I see as wrong about "popularity contest" questions.</p>

				<h3>Score ::7</h3>
				<p><p>No - votes time out and only get cleared if a moderator takes a binding action.</p>

<p>However, you can favorite the question and watch it and vote to reopen it should enough people cast close votes to actually close the question.</p>

<p>And of course, flagging it would be appropriate - just as if you saw any other question that was flagged and you felt in reality it was closed incorrectly.</p>

				<p><p>Yes you can, since 15th July 2013. Click the close button again after voting to close and you have the option to retract your vote.</p>
