				<h2>404 Image Nominations</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/the-7-essential-meta-questions-of-every-beta/">Top 7</a>, we need to select a 404 image - an image that will be displayed when users try to bring up a page that does not exist.</p>

				<p>Nice, this definitely should be one of the images used, though this might work better as a 503 than a 404.</p>

				<p>@Kyle Cronin: ya you're right, it would be perfect for a 503 (which hopefully won't happen very often).</p>

				<p>Yeah, what Mart n said. The image and style (translated text) would be great. But the actual text needs to be changed...</p>

				<p>Clever, but for any usage I think we would need all of the non-English languages translated. Google Translate doesn't count.</p>

				<p>I can have it perfectly translated to Spanish, Italian and German. I have a french friend who would be able to do the French part. Good luck with the  japanese?</p>

			<div id = "comment-496" class = "post">
				<p>Why translate it?  It's the way the kernel panic screen looks and is a huge part of the gag.  It doesn't have to have every language in the workd on it, that's not the way the real one looks.</p>

				<p><p>We could use the image that a Mac uses when it can't find the startup drive:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.cultofmac.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/mac-queston-mark2.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>It's a little small, but we could scale it/pad it with gray.</p>

				<p>I'm sure Jin could riff on that theme and come up with something appropriate that would work with the site's style.</p>

Or a windows logo will be good. 
That or one of those Windows error messages that says something like "error: process completed successfully".  </p>

<p>(yes I do realise this is apple.SE but apple things <em>never</em> go wrong ;) )</p>

<p>EDIT: or something similar to this picture <a href="http://cdn.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/win-eating-apple.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://cdn.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/win-eating-apple.jpg</a> or in reverse. </p>
