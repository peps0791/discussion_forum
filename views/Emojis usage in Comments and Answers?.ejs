				<p><p>Given that <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/41228/why-do-emoji-like-%EF%BF%BD%EF%BF%BD-appear-when-i-use-safari-but-not-chrome/41347#41347">emoji support is not uniform across all browsers</a> I would caution anyone attempting to use them in a question or answer to think carefully before doing so. Unless it adds a serious bit of relevant context to your question or answer, my advice would be to avoid them.</p>

<p>Sorry to   on your parade.</p>
