				<h2>Why didn't my 100 reputation bonus get applied?</h2>
<p>Obviously this belongs on <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/">https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/</a> instead of here, but I can't ask a question there without a 5 reputation here on <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/">https://apple.stackexchange.com/</a> first!</p>

<p>When I created my account here, I linked it with my other StackExchange accounts (15 others). When I did this upon creating the other SE accounts, I got a +100 reputation bonus, allowing me to upvote/comment/etc. </p>

<p>Why didn't I get that rep bonus here?</p>

<p>I see from <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/62/starting-reputation-at-101-vs-1/63#63">Starting reputation at 101 vs 1?</a> that you only get the bonus with a 200 rep on the other sites. While I don't have much rep on most sites, I do have it on StackOverflow.</p>

<p>What's up with this?</p>

<p>Tried to tag this: frustration stackexchange reputation should-be-on-meta</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don't have the 150 rep required to do that either.</p>

<p>Apparently I need to give it an existing tag now too. Great. SO used to be easy/fun to use. If I had to start over from scratch like this on each SE site, I'd never come back. </p>

<p>Tagging this: settings because nothing is really appropriate.</p>

				<p><p>Sorry for the trouble you're having. I'm not sure why you didn't get the association bonus at first, but it appeared when I unassociated/reassociated your accounts. You now have 101 rep.</p>

				<p>Thanks! I almost tried to "Clear All Associations" but that seemed permanent and it wasn't clear whether I could reassociate the accounts after that. (Plus, if I'd tried that it would hinder someone from looking into the issue.) Thanks again!</p>

				<p>Not sure if it's relevant, but I'll share this in case it helps fix the issue for someone else. When logging in for the first time to Apple.SE, I left the myOpenID option "Include information from profile:" set to "New Persona" (the default). Every other time I'd associated an account, I'd changed this to "Send no information."</p>
