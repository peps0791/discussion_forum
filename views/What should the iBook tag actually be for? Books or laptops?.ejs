				<h2>What should the iBook tag actually be for? Books or laptops?</h2>
<p>While retagging <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/58360/8823">this question</a> to remove the 'iBooks' tag (which is clearly associated with Apple's e-book business, not their old iBook laptop line), I noticed that the singular <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ibook">iBook tag</a> is frequently associated with <em>both</em> the books and laptop.</p>

<p>There are too many questions there (or so it seems to me) to do a quick and obvious reconciliation, so I wanted to ask for consensus: should the <strong>iBook</strong> tag be applied to the eponymous laptop, should it be a synonym for <em>iBooks</em>, both, neither?</p>

<p>I prefer the former option, since the older-model laptops carried the trade name iBook, while I've rarely ever heard an Apple-provided e-book referred to in the singular as an "iBook".</p>

				<p><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ibooks" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;ibooks&#39;" rel="tag">ibooks</a> should apply exclusively to Apple's e-books offering. Maybe it should also be a synonym of the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ibookstore" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;ibookstore&#39;" rel="tag">ibookstore</a>? Perhaps not.</p>

<p><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ibook" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;ibook&#39;" rel="tag">ibook</a> should apply exclusively to Apple's classic laptop line.</p>

<p>I can't think of a situation in which one would put the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ibook" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;ibook&#39;" rel="tag">ibook</a> tag to signify a question about a specific e-book.</p>

				<p>I agree in theory with @JasonSalaz's solution <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ibooks" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;ibooks&#39;" rel="tag">ibooks</a> for the app and <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ibook" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;ibook&#39;" rel="tag">ibook</a> for the hardware.</p>

<p>Hopwever I think that users will not read the wiki and will carry on misusing the tags.</p>

<p>I think as iBook is now an old machine that a better solution would be to make the tag for the machine to be <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ibook-laptop" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;ibook-laptop&#39;" rel="tag">ibook-laptop</a> and remove an not allow [tag:iBook to be used]. Even then I would not be suprised to see machine related questions being wrongly tagged but this way would lead to the least errors.</p>

				<p>I agree that <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ibooks" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;ibooks&#39;" rel="tag">ibooks</a> should refer to the eBooks, but perhaps to avoid confusion, we could use <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ibook-g4" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;ibook-g4&#39;" rel="tag">ibook-g4</a> and <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ibook-g3" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;ibook-g3&#39;" rel="tag">ibook-g3</a> (or similar) as the tags for the hardware? A bit more distinction beyond plural/singular would probably be a useful thing.</p>
