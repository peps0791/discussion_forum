				<h2>What's up with the red on green bubbles?</h2>
<p>I'm not colorblind, but these bubbles from the reputation summary / recent changes page are really pushing the envelope into "fugly". Could someone here have a word with the designers and see if they meant to enact this change?</p>

<p>Even yellow/purple or orange/blue is better for people that are colorblind if you really want to use contrasting / opposing colors for this...</p>

				<p><p>This was my fault for assuming the text was white already on the other SE sites when adding this styling.  <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/users/6/jin">Jin</a> pushed a CSS update so that the text on these <em>is</em> now white everywhere, it should look much better now.</p>

<p>Edit - it looks MUCH better - so happy it was an oops (and a minor one at that.) Speedy fix FTW.

				<p>Thanks Nick. I'll be tweaking the green to each site's proper green shade this weekend. For now, white text helps as a quick fix.</p>

				<p>Very impressed by the speed of resolution. Thanks again to both of you, the apple site colors are very well done. Thanks @nick-craver and @jin</p>
