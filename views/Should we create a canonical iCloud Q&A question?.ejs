	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>We are getting more and more questions about iCloud, and if you go through the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/icloud" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;icloud&#39;" rel="tag">icloud</a> you will find a lot of them relate to people misunderstanding iCloud and how it works, including backup.</p>

<p>On SU we handle these by creating a canonical question which we can use to close all these questions and not have to repeat the answers.</p>

<p>(I have answered a few of these and I often copy and paste from my previous answers)</p>

<p>Thoughts? Ideas? Should we do it?</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>This might be a good idea for certain components of iCloud, but I think that doing one question for iCloud as a whole might be sub-optimal as iCloud isn't really a single thing but a collection of separate cloud-based services.</p>

<p>So having a canonical question for mail, contacts, and calendar might be nice, and a separate one for documents, and a separate one for App Store and iBookstore, and one for iTunes, etc. might be the best approach.</p>
