	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>With 26 questions tagged <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/accounts" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;accounts&#39;" rel="tag">accounts</a>, 19 questions tagged <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/users" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;users&#39;" rel="tag">users</a> and 4 questions tagged <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/users%2baccounts" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;users+accounts&#39;" rel="tag">users+accounts</a> it is unclear to me when to use which.</p>

<p>Should these two tags be merged? Or, if not, how should their tag-wikis be updated, so their use cases would be distinct and clear.</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/accounts" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;accounts&#39;" rel="tag">accounts</a> should be for questions involving services that offer accounts, such as iTunes.<br>
<a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/users" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;users&#39;" rel="tag">users</a> should be for questions involving user accounts, such as those on OS X.</p>

<p>As neither has a wiki, it's unsurprising that people have gotten confused. It's cleanup time!</p>
