				<h2>Chat status on landing page of Apple.se ?</h2>
<p>I see Photo.se has an entry to left side of the landing page (<a href="http://photo.stackexchange.com">http://photo.stackexchange.com</a>). I wish Apple.se also could have the same.</p>

<p>If I want to see about the chat room status, I have to click on a question, then only I can see the status of it ! </p>

<p>Can we fix this ?</p>

				<p>This is something that can probably be included in the final design of the site once we launch.</p>

				<p>This are two completely different question, could ask another question about the chat room status?</p>

				<p>@dori he was talking about the *left* side, so I thought it was something else besides the chat box. But I didn't understood what it could be. It makes more sense, now :)</p>

				<p>@Dori DBA is still in beta **and** has the Chat box on the front page. But it's not (yet?) applied on our site.</p>

				<p>@Dori, I don't know if it was included on DBA.SE. But first of all, Jeff didn't add the "status-completed" tag. So that *should* mean that they fixed it on DBA and he asked the dev team to fix it here too. But I'm just guessing.</p>

				<p>your answer is some what confusing to me and other mods here. I didn't see chat box appearing on Apple.se website still. Are you referring to DBA.se or normal database issue for this site ? Can you please give more info here..</p>
