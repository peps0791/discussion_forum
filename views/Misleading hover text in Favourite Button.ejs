				<h2>Misleading hover text in Favourite Button</h2>
<p>Hover over the favourite button, and you see the following text (Spelling mistakes amended ;) )</p>

<p>"This is a favourite question (click again to undo)"</p>

<p>This implies that you have made the question a favourite already, and clicking will undo it.  But the text is the same regardless of if you have made it a favourite or not.</p>

<p>I came across a question that I set, and saw that it had a favourite count.  When I hovered and read the text, I clicked again to undo, not realising I had done that to my own question.  Of course this just increased the count as the first favourite was from someone else.</p>

<p>Can we amend the text to make it context insensitive?  Something like: "Click to toggle this question as a favourite" or "click to set/unset this question as a favourite"</p>

				<p>Actually more tooltips are like this, thus it's by design and not a bug.
If you hover on the Upvote it displays: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question shows research effort; it is useful and clear</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you hover on the Downvote it displays: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This question does not show any research effort; it is unclear or not
  useful</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It does explain you what happens <strong>when you click it</strong>, thus not a bug.</p>
