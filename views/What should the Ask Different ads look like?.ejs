				<h2>What should the Ask Different ads look like?</h2>
<p>[I heard you guys all saying, "gee, I wish there were more meta posts from CHAOS for me to weigh in on," so I thought I'd oblige!]</p>

<p>We are toying with the idea of putting ads for Ask Different on Stack Overflow. Specifically, they'd go on the [osx] and [ios] tag pages, or perhaps on questions with those tags. We'll get <a href="https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/147574/jin">our awesome designer</a> to put the actual ad together (though he doesn't know it yet...), but before we get to that point, we need some ideas. </p>

<p>The ad can be anything you want. It can be in the same style as the other ads running around the network that contain sample questions...</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wyqLY.png" alt="which look like this"></p>

<p>...or it can be an image with a logo...</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xGlqi.jpg" alt="which looks like this"></p>

<p>...or it can be anything else you guys want.</p>

<p>So! What are your ideas? </p>

				<p>I would LOVE a flash ad with a Steve Jobs surrounded by flashing lights saying "You won a free iPad". Oh, and lots of sound!</p>

				<p><p>I would certainly have one or two appeal to people with strong opinions/ windows or linux background. Engaging / inviting them in would be good for the site.</p>

<hr>

<p>Other random ideas in the hat are...</p>

<p>Maybe something like curious about the "mac side of the moon". (with a moon crescent silouette photo / just the words and the Ask Different icon in the corner)</p>

<p>Or a 2001 style rectangular object and a tag line - "My god, it's full of Apple answers"</p>

<p>It would have to be subtle and in good taste (and respectful of trademarks), but something that edged up to "what color is that kool-aid you have in your glass?" might be fun to work on.</p>

<p>Just some crazy half-baked ideas...</p>

				<p>Are you suggesting the 'mac side of the moon' as a way to engage windows/linux folks like you suggested in your first line? Or is that a separate thought?</p>

			<div id = "comment-1164" class = "comment">
				<p>They all are independent - the idea of attracting win/Linux is an idea to kick around - then I made three theme suggestions that don't really play on Linux or windows from where I sit...</p>

				<p>roger, was just wondering - "dark side of the moon" could sorta seem like a "come over to the dark side..." idea.</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-1166" class = "comment">
				<p>also: "that's no moon!"</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-1168" class = "comment">
				<p>Ha ha - indeed. The good designer might make it hard to tell which side of the moon was which - or even have it change yin/yang from top to bottom to make a point that perhaps your side isn't so fixed :-)</p>

				<p>I love the 2001 idea. But it's sure to generate complaints that iPhone didn't even exist back then ;-)</p>

				<p>Would love to see some mockups of these if you feel like it. Hint, hint, hint.</p>
