				<h2>How are edited characters counted?</h2>
<p>When I edit a question and change a link from <a href="http://www.example.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.example.com</a> to <code>[this](http://www.example.com)</code>, does it count as 8 characters edited, or as deleting the whole link and retyping (so 30 characters)? When I look at my edit again and see an an edited link I made, all of it is striked through and new text next to it written in green. Does this mean that I edited more characters?</p>

<p>The same with code blocks and blockquotes. How exactly does the character edit counting system work?</p>

			<div id = "post-ans" class = "post">
				<p>The edited characters count for the purposes of the minimum edit count is based on the number of non-whitespace characters that are edited in a post.</p>

<p>This means that:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>example</code> to <code>**example**</code> is an edit of four characters, not 11 (or 7).</li>
<li>Prepending four spaces to a line for a code block is an edit of zero characters, as all the characters are whitespace.</li>
<li>Prepending a <code>&gt;</code> for a quote block is an edit of one character, regardless of how many characters are in the quote block itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>The edited characters count for the automatic edit summary (available >2k) includes whitespace character changes, therefore showing 4 characters when adding a code block.</p>
