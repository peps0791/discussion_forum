	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>I asked the following question recently:
<a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/66192/small-case-for-mac-book-air-that-will-hold-charger-and-mouse#comment78237_66192">Small case for mac book air that will hold charger and mouse?</a></p>

<p>and was curious why it was closed.</p>

<p>One person mentioned that he considered it a shopping question and that's why he thought it was shut down.  I had assumed since I wasn't asking for a place to buy a product or where I can find good prices, that this would not be considered a shopping question, but maybe I'm wrong.</p>

<p>Are questions about whether there exists equipment that meets specific requirements not appropriate for the Apple SE site? Any guidance for future questions welcome.</p>
