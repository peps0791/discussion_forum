				<h2>Possible bug in the contest share count</h2>
<p>Here s a screenshot from <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/3117/adam-eberbach">Adam Eberbach s profile</a> (not that it matters who it s from   this is just so you can reproduce the issue):</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Op8pT.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Note that it says  19/20 shares , even though level 3 is 100% complete. I assume that after completion of level 3, one of the questions/answers Adam shared got deleted or closed. Apparently, this has the side effect of not counting towards the total share count anymore.</p>

<p>Is this a bug or a feature?</p>

<p>And, by extension, if contest questions/answers are deleted/closed, will the votes they gained still be considered in the final count, or not?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> To clarify, I know <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1205/4408">completed missions won t be revoked</a>   I m just wondering what happens to the total score when one of the questions/answers gets deleted/closed.</p>

				<p>This is as intended. As I've previously said (you've linked to the quote), once you've finished a mission, we will not revoke that mission again unless the mission has been accomplished by &hellip; less-than-fair means.</p>

<p>The contest site has a (dev-only) list of those users who have accomplished a mission, but <em>according to current stats</em> would not qualify. I look at that list at least once a day to check on it (it currently lists two users, Adam and one Mission 1 winner), and neither of these cases look irregular. So there's no reason to revoke these missions; at some point, the objectives where fulfilled, and thus the mission accomplished.</p>

<p>The profile widget shows a full bar (100%) if the mission is completed, but it doesn't lie about the stats. To be precise (and to comment on speculations about rounding errors), the percentage is deliberately designed to be at 100% <em>if and only if</em> the mission is completed. Having achieved 99.8% of a mission is still 99%, and having achieved a mission but not matching the stats <em>anymore</em> still puts you at 100%.</p>
