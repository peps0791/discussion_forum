				<h2>Deleting a question I asked on mobile site</h2>
<p>Earlier I deleted a question that I asked which had generated no activity. I did this while browsing the mobile site. When I clicked 'delete' I got a popup to confirm and was then redirected to a 'page not found' because the question had been deleted, by me. However, this page was not formatted for mobile so I thought I'd raise this in case it's a bug.</p>
