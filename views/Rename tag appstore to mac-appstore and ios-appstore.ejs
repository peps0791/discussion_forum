	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>Since Apple's Mac Appstore is coming in less than 90 days, should we think about renaming all <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/appstore" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;appstore&#39;" rel="tag">appstore</a> question to <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ios-appstore" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;ios-appstore&#39;" rel="tag">ios-appstore</a>, before all the question related to the Mac Appstore start to appear?</p>

<p>And in the process, create the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mac-appstore" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;mac-appstore&#39;" rel="tag">mac-appstore</a> tag.</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/appstore" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;appstore&#39;" rel="tag">appstore</a> to <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ios-appstore" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;ios-appstore&#39;" rel="tag">ios-appstore</a> migrated. <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mac-appstore" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;mac-appstore&#39;" rel="tag">mac-appstore</a> hasn't been made yet.</p>


<p>Please update the tag synonyms. I've had to fill in five captchas while trying to tag <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/3572/1451">this question</a> <code>app-store</code> and I would never have made it without knowing StackExchange in depth in the first place. The whole process was very frustrating.</p>


<p>on apple.com it says summer, not 90 days</p>
