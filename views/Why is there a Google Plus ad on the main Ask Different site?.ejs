		<p>I ended up at <a href="https://plus.google.com/101120115153580954446/posts" rel="nofollow">https://plus.google.com/101120115153580954446/posts</a> when I clicked the ad (same destination and largely identical content whether I am logged into a Google account or not).</p>

<p>The above-linked page seems to be a Google+ account for  Stack Exchange  to post various things:  interesting  questions from various SE sites (similar the <a href="http://twitter.com/stackexchange" rel="nofollow">SE Twitter account</a>), but also podcast episode notifications, and some other SE-related news. It seems very similar to the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/stackexchange" rel="nofollow">SE page on Facebook</a>.</p>

<p>Joel Spolsky recently <a href="https://twitter.com/spolsky/status/141912830462005248" rel="nofollow">tweeted that  You can also follow Stack Exchange on Google+ </a> with a link to a <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/s/Stack%20Exchange" rel="nofollow">Google+ search for  Stack Exchange </a> (this was right after he <a href="https://twitter.com/spolsky/status/141911133505335296" rel="nofollow">tweeted</a> about the symmetry of SE on Facebook and Facebook on SE: facebook.com/stackexchange, facebook.stackoverflow.com).</p>

<p>The ad itself seems to be just one of the SE-promoting ads that SE injects into its sites (questions from other SE sites, site proposals from Area 51,  Join us on Facebook ,  Join us on G+ , et cetera).</p>
