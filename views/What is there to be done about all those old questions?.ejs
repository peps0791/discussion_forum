<p><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/36786/how-do-i-enroll-devices-while-can-enable-remote-management-is-disabled">How do I enroll devices while &quot;Can enable remote management&quot; is disabled?</a> was bumped just a few minutes ago, and is from 2012.</p>

<p>Since technology is changing a lot (unlike a lot of other SE topics), what can we do about this? These questions are very difficult to answer and are nearly uneditable because of how different iOS 4 and MobileMe were from iOS 11 and iCloud.</p>
