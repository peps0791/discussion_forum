				<h2>How can I get an answer to a user when I don't have enough rep to answer his question directly?</h2>
<p>An Ask Different user has a problem that I also had. I found a solution this morning and wanted to answer his question, but the question requires a 10 rep to answer. I have a six rep, so I can neither answer or comment on the question. I also looked for a way to message him, but found none. Is there a way to message him? Any ideas on how I can get this guy the solution to his problem?</p>

				<p><p>Post a link to the question. We can consider un-protecting it.</p>

<p>Or better: earn the reputation to answer it. You're only four rep points away. That's easy enough to obtain answering one, unprotected question with a great answer. Or doing some suggested edits to some questions and answers. Or some voting.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/whats-reputation">What is reputation? How do I earn it?</a> for some suggestions on how to break the 10 rep barrier.</p>

<p>It's not arduous or time consuming.</p>
