				<p><p>I'd like to personally apologize for some of my word and term transpositions in this episode. And I'd also like to personally thank Kyle for putting up with my sniffles, coughs, and all the rest. He did a really great job of filtering all that stuff out to make a much better listening experience!</p>

<p>I blame sickness :). It's a worthwhile scapegoat.</p>
