	<body id = 'pagebody'><p>I created a tag <code>[windows-alternative]</code> to describe a question where the OP is looking for an OS X alternative to an application that is Windows-only.  It doesn't feel quite right though, maybe someone has a suggestion for better tag to describe these types of posts?</p>

<p>FWIW, I also think that for these types of questions, this tag should be used instead of <code>[osx]</code>, since it's implicit that the poster is looking for an osx application</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>Maybe <code>[osx-apps]</code> or <code>[osx-application]</code> ? I'm not sold on <code>[windows-alternative]</code> as I feel it's a bit generic, though so are the other two I mentioned. </p>


<p>What about <code>[software-recommendation]</code> instead?</p>

<p>Of note, there used to be some concern over the length of the tag <a href="https://meta.superuser.com/questions/171/superuser-tagging-question-software-hardware-product-recommendations">last year</a> - I'm not sure what lists Jeff is referring to.</p>


<p>I know I'm a bit late, but if you're concern about the length of the tag, why not try : </p>

<pre><code>[software-advice]       # I prefer this one.
</code></pre>

<p>OR</p>

<pre><code>[software-suggestion]
</code></pre>
