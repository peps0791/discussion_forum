				<h2>Tag not longer presents</h2>
<p>A few weeks ago, I suggested a new tag related to 4K. The suggestion had been accepted but right now I don't see the tag anymore. </p>

<p>Is this normal? There is some regulation related to the evolution of the tags?</p>

				<p><p>The <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/151881">suggested edit 151881</a> shows that <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/4k" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;4k&#39;" rel="tag">4k</a> was the tag that was suggested to be added, but the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/posts/228423/revisions">post revisions</a> shows that <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retina-display" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;retina-display&#39;" rel="tag">retina-display</a> was added. <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/4k" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;4k&#39;" rel="tag">4k</a> was merged with <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retina-display" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;retina-display&#39;" rel="tag">retina-display</a>, but <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retina-display" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;retina-display&#39;" rel="tag">retina-display</a> is a synonym of <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/display" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;display&#39;" rel="tag">display</a>, and as such <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/tags/retina-display/synonyms">/tags/retina-display/synonyms</a> redirects to <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/tags/display/synonyms">/tags/display/synonyms</a> which doesn't show <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/4k" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;4k&#39;" rel="tag">4k</a> as a synonym, because it isn't. The <a href="/questions/tagged/bug" class="post-tag required-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;bug&#39;" rel="tag">bug</a> here is that the question shouldn't be able to be tagged with <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/retina-display" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;retina-display&#39;" rel="tag">retina-display</a> and <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/display" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;display&#39;" rel="tag">display</a> at the same time, as the former is a synonym of the latter.</p>

				<p>Sorry if I ask but, knowing that not all the times a retina-display corresponds to a 4k resolution. Isn't it better to have an independent tag for 4k to be used for questions like this: [Mac Pro + 50  4K Ultra HD LED TV as monitor   Best graphics card?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/228423/mac-pro-50-4k-ultra-hd-led-tv-as-monitor-best-graphics-card). Here the question is not referring to retina display!</p>

			<div id = "comment-6062" class = "comment">
				<p>@Mattia I somewhat agree. I don't think [retina-display]/etc should be a synonym of [display] which would allow [4k] to be a synonym of [retina-display].</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-6063" class = "comment">
				<p>More precisely, I think that in a Apple environment like Ask Different [retina-display] could be a synonym of [display], nowadays more or less all the Apple displays produced are retina. The point is that 4k in most of the cases is not related to Apple displays and to retina-displays. Anyway, I was just wondering why that tag was accepted and than it disappeared.</p>

				<p>@Mattia If display is linked to retina-display - what do you do for external displays or links via HDMI/VGA or just a generic display of a programetc Out of the newest 10 questions tagged display only one might be tagged as retina</p>
