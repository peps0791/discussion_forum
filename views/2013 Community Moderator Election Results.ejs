<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>Congrats Ian, patrix! I look forward to seeing the   next to your names, and for things to continue to be awesome with you on-board!</p>

<p>Now that we have an overseas mod, I'm going to have to find another time to fill in the moderation gaps. God knows most of my overnight flag handling was taking action on patrix, stuffe, bassplayer, and some other regulars' flags.</p>


<p>Thank you to the Stack Exchange team for running this election so smoothly and for working so hard to schedule the forum at a time that worked for so many of the candidates and site participants. Congratulations to the new mods. Thanks to all the candidates who ran.</p>
