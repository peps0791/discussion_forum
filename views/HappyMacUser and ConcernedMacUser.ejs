<p>These accounts from this <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/156921/22781">thread</a> looks like needs merging:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/101161/concernedmacuser">ConcernedMacUser</a></li>
<li><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/101201/happymacuser">HappyMacUser</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Is it possible to merge unregistered accounts?</p>

				<p>Technically - anyone can request a merge - use the contact us link at the bottom of any page and link the details you have here.</p>

<p>In specific, moderators can sometimes tell if accounts should be merged and can ask. Most of the time, moderators can't tell and have to rely on the user themselves to indicate a merge is needed.</p>

<p>It's not at all wrong to have many accounts - only when multiple accounts collude to vote or otherwise evade controls or abuse the system is merging and / or corrective actions warranted. Simply having two accounts isn't reason enough to request a merge in most cases.</p>

<p>In this case, it seems intentional and humorous and likely the same person. I'm not going to ask for a merge since the accounts are old and the OP / OP's aren't struggling to use the site.</p>
