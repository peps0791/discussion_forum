				<h2>If I'm a developer, can I ask questions here?</h2>
<p>Let's say I am developing an app or a service to run on or in conjunction with Apple hardware or software, I'm wondering what questions I can ask here and what I should ask elsewhere.</p>

<p>I've looked at the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/faq#questions">FAQ for Ask Different</a> and the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/faq#questions">FAQ for Stack Overflow</a> and sometimes it's not clear which, if either of these sites I should bring a specific question.</p>

<p>For instance, If I'm <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/88802/what-ios-setting-general-usage-indicate">struggling to make sense of iOS's Storage pane</a> or the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/89650/delete-application-from-iphone-5-1-simulator">iOS simulator is not behaving the way I want</a> - Are these questions OK here or should I take it elsewhere?</p>

<p>Additionally, I may have a <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/90055/how-do-you-create-an-ios-app-that-supports-a-bookshelf">question that has both policy and implementation details</a> and wonder where the line between on and off-topic lies for both here and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>.</p>

				<p>Yes. Please ask your question - even if you're not sure where it fits. We have users that will flag, vote, comment and close it if it isn't detailed enough or in the wrong place.</p>

<p>That being said, it's best to do a little research of both sites to avoid too much confusion if you asked a too user-centric question on Stack Overflow or ask a too much developer-centric question here.</p>

<p>The example is an easy one to answer: This is end user functionality (what is the meaning of the number displayed behind each application) so this fits perfectly into AskDifferent.  </p>

<p>If the question is rather "why does the number keep growing in my self-developed app", StackOverflow is definitively the better (and right) place because sooner or later it turns into coding and debugging. But they probably want to see a bit more analysis done upfront than just a "help, my app is eating memory".</p>

<p>In extension to the topics already covered in the FAQ, I currently use the following rules of thumb: If Objective C (or any other programming language besides shell scripting or AppleScript) code or debugging is involved, it belongs to stackoverflow.com. Everything else is usually fine on AD as well.</p>

				<p>This is a site aimed primarily at end users of Apple products rather than developers. That said, it isn't a site NOT for developers. There are plenty of questions that are of interest to both developers and end users. Just because a person is a developer doesn't mean their question is out of place here.</p>

<p>If a question is likely to produce answers that are helpful to people <strong>using</strong>, <strong>administering</strong>, or <strong>maintaining</strong> Apple hardware or software, that's on target for this site. If the answers are likely to be helpful (or comprehensible) only to people who create software for Apple products, I'd say that falls outside the scope of this site.</p>

<p>I'd say the test is to ask yourself who might find your answer helpful. If the answer is just you personally, the question is too localized. If the answer is just programmers, the question is off-topic for this site. If the answer could be helpful to non-programmers who use Apple products, please do ask it here.</p>

				<p>One thing to add to the answers and/or emphasise is if you are not sure.</p>

<p><strong>Look at both sites for similar questions</strong>.</p>

<p>First this will help you make a choice, you know what sort of answer you want and can see what sort of answers each site gives you.</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>In general especially for development (ie Stack Overflow) assume that the question has been asked before and only if you can't find then ask. There are a lot of developers and users out there and you probably won't be the first.</p>

<p>For example the iOSSimulator question was migrated to SO, which seems correct to me and then was immediately closed as a duplicate.</p>
