				<h2>Display date as red if it's longer than 2 years ago</h2>
<p>Sometimes <strong>Community</strong> (diamond) bumps questions which not have had an accepted answer to the top of the questions queue. However, some questions of these are over 2 or 3 years old. </p>

<p>Sometimes I'm close to putting a comment to an answer/a question and then see last second before posting it, the answer was about 2-3 years ago (and so was the question).
The comment is irrelevant at that point because example now; someone was explaining Windows XP in bootcamp, which isn't supported for a long time anymore (at least since OS X 10.6)</p>

<p>Could it be an option to display the date (on the bottom of a question and answer) in red if the date is 2 or more years old?</p>
