				<h2>Is it possible to post pictures in comments?</h2>
<p>I was wondering if it is possible to post pictures in comments? It might be useful for clarification of difficult questions. If not then could it be a feature?</p>

			</div>

				<p>It's not possible currently, but we can leave it here tagged as feature request. The site developers monitor questions tagged as <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/feature-request" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;feature-request&#39;" rel="tag">feature-request</a> so they will see both this and the votes that people have left for the feature to be implemented.</p>

<p>(Don't be alarmed if people down vote it - votes here work differently than on the main sites)</p>

				<p>I'd argue a picture, posted in a comment, should really be made as a clarifying edit to the answer or to the question -- wherever the comment was going to be made.</p>

				<p>If there really is a need for adding a picture to a comment (which I doubt due to the nature of comments here), there is always the possibility to add a link to the picture uploaded somewhere. </p>
