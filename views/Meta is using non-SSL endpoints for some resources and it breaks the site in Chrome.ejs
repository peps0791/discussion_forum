				<h2>Meta is using non-SSL endpoints for some resources and it breaks the site in Chrome</h2>
<p>For a few days now this has been a problem for me. I can no longer vote posts up or down on any meta channel from Chrome (Version 42.0.2311.152 (64-bit)) on OS X. Looking at the JavaScript console while trying to vote, it appears that Chrome is blocking a URI call because it's being made over a non-SSL end point:</p>

<p>The blocked calls occurred when I pressed the up-vote button. I get similar blocked calls in Chrome when I try to add an image to a question or answer on a meta channel.</p>

<p>It's only a problem on the meta channel. The main sites are fine.</p>

<p>I had to post this from...<em>shudder</em>...Safari to attach the image to the post. :)</p>

<p>Edit: this is possibly a problem for me because I visit all Stack Exchange sites via their https URLs and the meta sites have invalid certificates. This is what I get trying to use <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/">https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/</a> from Chrome:</p>

<p>If I come to the site via the non-encrypted endpoint it works fine in Chrome. Chrome really doesn't like when your site mixes https and http requests to its own domain (and rightly so).</p>

				<p>Figured it out.</p>

<p>First: the certificate for meta.apple.stackexchange.com is definitely invalid. That is, ultimately, at the heart of my problem.</p>

<p>But the problem for me, in Chrome, was caused by my use of the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/https-everywhere/gcbommkclmclpchllfjekcdonpmejbdp?hl=en" rel="nofollow">HTTPS Everywhere</a> Chrome extension. It was responsible for blocking the http calls to meta endpoints that were being made from an https meta page. Once I disable the extension for meta I could vote again.</p>

<p>This all, however, is just pointing a serious flaw in the use of https on the meta sites that needs to be fixed. I'll argue this stands as a bug.</p>
