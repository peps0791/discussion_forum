				<h2>There must be a better old question for "I lost my iPhone, now what do I do?"</h2>
<p>Upon reaching this new question, <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/193199/what-actions-can-be-taken-with-lost-and-locked-phone">"What actions can be taken with lost and locked phone?"</a> I followed the duplicate question link to <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/7837/lost-iphone-what-action-to-take">"Lost iPhone, what action to take?"</a> and read the answer and followed the links.</p>

<p>What? Really?  the answer is 4 years old, uses out of date terminology, has a broken apple link, and mobileMe links (that do forward to iCloud.com at least).</p>

				<p>I agree, the question needs a version more suitable for 2015. Do you want to volunteer to write one?</p>
