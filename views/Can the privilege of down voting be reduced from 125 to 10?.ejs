<p>It kind of unfair to HAVE to require 125 rep to vote down. </p>

<p>Can this be 10 to vote up and vote down?</p>

				<p><p>I wouldn't call it unfair, it's just one of the rules valid on all StackExchange sites. One of the reasons that users are required to have at least some reputation before voting is to actually increase the quality of the votes (and to prevent spammers from creating a bunch of accounts and voting each other up).</p>

<p>If you look at <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/whats-reputation">https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/whats-reputation</a>, getting to 15 reputation isn't all that hard (either post a good answer to one of the questions or invest some time to improve 8 posts by editing them). </p>

				<p>@Inofearu since voting down costs rep on answers, this protects your reputation till you have enough to spend on them.</p>
