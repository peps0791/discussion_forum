<p>Is this some kind of glitch, or an actual message?<br>
Can't read it [can't even pronounce cyrillic let alone translate it], can't copy/paste it as the entire message is a link in that drop menu.</p>

<p>Link itself just goes to <a href="http://ru.stackoverflow.com">http://ru.stackoverflow.com</a> not any specific message page.</p>

<p>I'm not signed up to StackOverflow itself, English or Russian so can't really post it to their Meta.</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>It's an automated Stack Exchange message asking you to help with Stack Overflow in Russian. These messages are usually sent for events such as a moderator election being held on a site that you have an account on. Receiving a message for a site you don't have an account on seems like a bug, unless this is a special message I'm not aware of.</p>

<p>I seem to recall receiving a similar message about a different site a very long time ago, but perhaps I'm misremembering. Unfortunately these kinds of messages don't appear in the inbox API endpoint, so I can't search my inbox history.</p>

<p>By the way, running the message <a href="https://translate.google.co.uk/#ru/en/%D0%A1%D0%BE%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%89%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%0AStack%20Overflow%20%D0%BD%D0%B0%20%D1%80%D1%83%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%20%D0%BD%D1%83%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%81%D1%8F%20%D0%B2%20%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%B9%20%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%89%D0%B8!" rel="nofollow">through Google Translate</a> gives me the following:</p>
