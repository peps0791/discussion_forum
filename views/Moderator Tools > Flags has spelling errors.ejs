				<h2>Moderator Tools > Flags has spelling errors</h2>
<p>In the headings of the help text on the right-hand side of the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/tools?s=1&amp;tab=flags">Moderator Tools > Flags</a> page, the two instances of the word "I" should be capitalized. I recognize that these headings have a lowercase-only motif; the word "I", as a proper noun (proper pronoun?) should be capitalized anyway.</p>

				<p>As I don't have access to any other site's mod tools, I can't check them, so I posted here. If this is endemic (as I suspect), I'll be happy to assist in the moving of this question to MSO.</p>

				<p>You can call the lower-case letters a "mofif"; I call it an error.</p>

				<p>@DanielLawson The sentences don't start with capital letters; I assumed that was deliberate. It could be an error, in which they should be fixed, too.</p>

				<p>The developers monitor the bug tag on all sites the last I heard so it's not necessary to migrate to the main meta. Flag it if you'd like that as it's clearly something not specific to our site.</p>

				<p>@bmike I tend to consider incorrect capitalization (in cases like this) to be a spelling error.</p>

				<p>I'm flattening [tag:spelling] and [tag:grammar] to design since that covers the site design as a whole - type, copy and graphics. I agree with you in the real world this would be a spelling / proofreading issue with the copy.</p>

				<p>@CajunLuke It might have been deliberate, but an error made deliberately is still an error :-)</p>
