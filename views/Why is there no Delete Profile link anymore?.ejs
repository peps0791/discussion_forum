<p>Under "Edit Profile" should've been an option for leaving the community.</p>

<p>Am I looking in the wrong place?</p>


<h1>ANSWERS</h1>
		<p>You can only self-delete your profile if the profile has <strong>never voted</strong> and has <strong>posted at most once</strong> in the history of the account. If this is not true, the Delete Profile link will not be shown.</p>

<p>To delete a profile which does not meet this criteria, use the <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/contact">contact us</a> link and choose  I need to delete my user profile .</p>

<p>Practically, it's simpler to just anonymize your profile if that's what you want - deletion just automates the anonymization of your posts and profile. If you're asking about linking accounts - that's a different path: <a href="http://stackexchange.com/users/218740/bmike?tab=accounts">http://stackexchange.com/users/218740/bmike?tab=accounts</a></p>
