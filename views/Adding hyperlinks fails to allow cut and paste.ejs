				<h2>Adding hyperlinks fails to allow cut and paste</h2>
<p>Trying to insert a hyperlink now fails as I cannot paste into the pop up box.</p>

<p>This worked in beta and still does on other stack exchange sites.</p>

				<p>how odd, indeed I can confirm this..</p>

			<div id = "comment-686" class = "comment">
				<p>Yeah, it works if you delete the `http://` before pasting</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-689" class = "comment">
				<p>Thanks for that Griffo - I've just been clicking ok with the http:// url, and then pasting my own link after that. Kind of a pain, but should be an easy fix</p>

				<p>This must be the absolutely weirdest browser bug I've ever seen (it only happens in Chrome). This was caused by a CSS rule that has nothing to do with anything even *remotely* related to that input box.</p>

				<p>For those interested, this is the bug: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=60057</p>
