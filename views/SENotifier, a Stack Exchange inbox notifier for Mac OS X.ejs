				<h2>SENotifier, a Stack Exchange inbox notifier for Mac OS X</h2>
<p>I've put together a <a href="https://stackapps.com/questions/3081/senotifier-a-stack-exchange-inbox-notifier-for-mac-os-x">status bar notifier for Stack Exchange sites</a> (inspired by Google Notifier) and I thought I'd ask here to get some feedback on a couple of things.</p>

<p><a href="http://hewgill.com/senotifier/senotifier.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">screenshot http://hewgill.com/senotifier/senotifier.png</a></p>

<p>I've developed this on Lion and am curious about whether it works on previous releases of OS X (or whether this even matters very much, in practical terms). This is my first Mac OS X app ever, so I'm not even sure what issues are important.</p>

<p>Also, it sort of needs an application icon, so if you're feeling inclined, artwork would get you a mention and a link in the About panel!</p>

<p>Any other comments and suggestions are welcome.</p>

				<p>@GregHewgill I've been waiting for such a tool for OSX ever since I saw it for Ubuntu! Thank you!</p>

				<p>I have a draft for the icon  It's nothing impressive, but what do you think? Do you want something more original? http://i.imgur.com/CQFKm.png</p>

				<p><p>To answer your question about its compatibility with previous versions of Mac OS X, I encountered an error when trying to run the program on my Panther machine. So it does not work on 10.3.9.</p>

				<p>Thanks, I might have predicted that. :) I've tried it on 10.6 so it appears to work there too, but since I've used ARC it's unlikely to work on 10.5 or earlier.</p>

				<p><p>I noticed the layout for OpenID-based logins is a bit weird (tested on OS X 10.7.3):</p>

<p>Just a heads up.</p>

<p>Thanks for your work on this wonderful app!</p>

				<p>Thanks. I noticed this too, but nothing I've been able to do seems to change the look. It's just a totally ordinary OS-provided WebView, so I'm not sure what's going on. I'll keep looking though.</p>

				<p>@GregHewgill That s weird indeed, as it renders as expected in Safari/WebKit. Strange!</p>
