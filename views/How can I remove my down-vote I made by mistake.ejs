				<h2>How can I remove my down-vote I made by mistake</h2>
<p>I recently accidentally down-voted an answer without realising (think it was because of a miss click when scrolling on the iOS app). The only issue is I cannot remove that down-vote now because of this error.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JDmME.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Would any mod/admin be kind enough to remove it (and give my back my 1 reputation) please?</p>

<p>Thanks for your help and any inconvenience I have caused.</p>

<p>The link to the post I down-voted is here: <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/102271/cannot-access-vital-boot-options-on-mac-pro-with-os-x-lion/127955#127955">Cannot access vital boot options on Mac Pro with OS X Lion</a> (it scrolls to the answer)</p>

				<p>I've edited the question slighly, you should be able to undo your vote now.</p>

<p>OTOH, down voting that answer isn't totally unjustified...</p>
