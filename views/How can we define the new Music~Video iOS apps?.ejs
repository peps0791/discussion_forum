				<h2>How can we define the new Music~Video iOS apps?</h2>
<p>iOS 5 brought us Music and Video as two seperate apps, these cannot be tagged correctly as the description for Music relates to songs and sond that is playing not the app, and the same applies to video.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any suggestions for creating tags specfically for these apps?</p>

				<p>While not ultra-elegant, I've found myself referring to these programs as Music.app, Video.app and, to extend the system, Mail.app to distinguish the application from the overall concept.</p>

<p>I am suggesting this "without ego" because I agree (in advance) with those who find the solution ugly and cumbersome. </p>

				<p>Another approach would be to leverage the existing hyphen methodology:</p>

<p>music-app</p>

<p>video-app</p>

<p>mail-app </p>

<p>The last would presumably be further refined through the use of additional operating system tags. </p>

<p>This approach is somehow less "ugly" to my eye.  It doesn't modify the names of the applications as we normally see them.</p>
