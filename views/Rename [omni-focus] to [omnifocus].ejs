				<h2>Rename [omni-focus] to [omnifocus]</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus" rel="nofollow noreferrer">OmniFocus</a> is one word, however the tag <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/omni-focus" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;omni-focus&#39;" rel="tag">omni-focus</a> is hyphenated.<br>
Can the tag be renamed <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/omnifocus" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged &#39;omnifocus&#39;" rel="tag">omnifocus</a> to reflect the correct word?</p>

				<p>Where do you want to rename it? In the Finder? Evernote? OmniFocus? We need more info.</p>

				<p>@Tunes I think you're misunderstanding this question, or indeed meta as a whole. Meta is for questions about Ask Different itself, and I am talking about renaming the tag on the site.</p>

				<p>I am not 'picking', perhaps in some minds that's clear but it wasn't obvious to me and adding a noun to the expression would prevent others from making that mistake. :-) However at this point anyone reading these comments that doesn't know will figure it out. So perhaps we are ahead in the game?</p>

				<p>@Tunes I'm not sure I understand what you are saying. How did you make it on to meta in the first place to find this question?</p>

				<p>@grgarside Yes, please change it. While you're at it, change omni-graffle to omnigraffle as well. Thank you.</p>
