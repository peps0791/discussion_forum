				<h2>Is it good-practice to use a comment (or parts of it) of someone else to answer a question?</h2>
<p>I wanted to answer this <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/160001/binding-multiple-items-to-clipboard">question</a>. But the user jherran was faster commenting this question instead of answering it.</p>

<p>So i just added a comment instead of answering it, expecting jherran will add an answer based on his   in my opinion correct   comment (and maybe other peoples comments) soon.</p>

<p>I still hesitate to answer it because i feel uncomfortable to "steal" someone else's answer.</p>

<p>What is good-practice or considered polite in such a case?</p>

				<p><p>I would say just answer it. I would put more content in an answer than your comment, but if the other person wants to answer it they can too. That's how SE is supposed to work. People answer the questions and other people vote those answers up or down. </p>

				<p>+1 for both Q&A. Sometimes I 'know an answer' but don't have the time/energy to flesh it out properly, so I drop in a quick comment. If someone with time & inclination wants to fill it out properly, I certainly would not begrudge a few points, in the interest of keeping the overall site quality high. [It would only actually bother me if it was noticeably a 'quick gain' ploy by a 1-point user.]</p>

				<p>@Tetsujin Exactly. Particularly with linked answers. Comments are the place where I drop the  link only answers.  If I m either too lazy to summarize it, or the link just says it best and requires no summary, I just leave a comment.</p>

				<p><p>Please always use an answer as comments are (sometimes) pretty pointless. An answer is something I read at first when I open a new question.</p>
