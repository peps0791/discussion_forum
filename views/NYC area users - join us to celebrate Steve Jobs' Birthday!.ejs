				<h2>NYC area users - join us to celebrate Steve Jobs' Birthday!</h2>
<p>Come join Ask Different and <a href="http://drbrendan.com/" rel="nofollow">Dr. Brendan</a> for a party to honor Steve Jobs on his birthday. The party will start around 3 pm EST, and will take place outside the flagship Apple Store in NYC (59th Street and Fifth Avenue). </p>

<p>There will be black turtlenecks, cupcakes, and dancers. For more information, see this <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/fans_day_fete_for_jobs_HQzFUcSxhYb531oFfG6kmJ" rel="nofollow">New York Post article</a> covering the event. This event was also <a href="http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000075169" rel="nofollow">covered by CNBC</a> this morning, so we're hoping for a great turnout! </p>

<p>If you can't make it to the event, we will be live tweeting it from @StackApple, so follow along!</p>

				<p>I'm sorry, but this seems more than a little exploitive of the memory of Steve Jobs.</p>

				<p>@KyleCronin SJ's vision permeates tech culture and I prefer to celebrate this in a positive way!</p>

				<p>@SethRogers I have no problem with people celebrating Steve Jobs in their own way, though in this case I think it's a bit tasteless. However, this is ostensibly a promotion for Stack Exchange - it was mentioned in the NY Post article and the CNBC interview; you even had a Stack Exchange shirt on. And that's what I object to - using the memory of Steve Jobs, who has only been dead a few *months* to promote the company and this site.</p>

				<p>it's a birthday party for a visionary we all admired @KyleCronin. Point taken though. Thanks!</p>

				<p>The CNBC interview is all about what big fans Seth and Brendan are of Steve Jobs - they only mention Ask Different to say where Seth is from. I think it's a very tasteful interview, and we don't intend for this to be an excuse for a promotion. But we do see your point Kyle. Don't want you to think we're being insensitive.</p>

				<p>The Ask Different moderators weren't involved in advance of this promotion?</p>

				<p>I'm not aware of any site users including the moderators that knew of this before the blog post went up. Of course the SE employees / CHAOS team and employees that printed up the balloons would be excluded.</p>

				<p><p>The party was a TON of fun! The cupcakes and turtlenecks set a really great vibe and there were a few dozen people who joined us for the event. SJ's memory was celebrated in such a positive way - people were all smiles reflecting on how SJ changed their lives personally or just how much they loved their Apple products.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately is was raining and cold, so people were afraid of getting their devices wet (mostly iPhones and iPods). The cupcakes also got a bit wet. All in all though, it was a memorable and happy birthday party for all the SJ admirers who attended.</p>

<p>I know some people got a bad taste in their mouths about this party; I'm sorry for that. For me, the party was a fun way to remember a visionary we all looked up to and those who made it out through the rain and cold seemed to have a really great time too. I think their was certainly a problem in the communication of this event, it was written about and publicized in a way that could have obscured the true joy of the party. </p>
