				<h2>How, exactly, would winners be determined if more than five users complete Level 3?</h2>
<p>In the <a href="http://thenewipadishere.com/" rel="nofollow">New iPad Contest</a>, the rules state:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We can give away a maximum of 25 iPod touch devices and a maximum of 6 new iPads (5 for Level 3, and 1 for the raffle). In the event that more than the maximum number of people complete the Levels, the winners with the highest combined score on their contest posts will be chosen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Should more than five users complete Level 3 (a possibility looking more and more likely, despite my prediction that we'd be lucky if a grand total of two people completed the challenge!), how exactly are winners chosen? It says "highest combined score on their contest posts", but which posts are contest posts for Level 3 purposes? The first 35 questions asked during the contest? The highest scoring 35 questions asked during the contest? All not closed, not deleted questions and answers from the contest time period?</p>

				<p>Lauren, part of the community development/evangelism team (CHAOS) at Stack Exchange that is running this contest, <a href="https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1227/219">posted the following clarification</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To figure out who the "top 5" are, we'll look at the posts you made for the contest and figure out the total combined score (so if all 35 of your posts had a score of 6, your combined score would be 35*6 = 210). The 5 who have the highest combined score will get an iPad.</p>
