				<h2>How to raise reputation number?</h2>
<p>The sole reason i joined <strong>AskDifferent</strong> is to give a answer to question. But I was unable to do that as my answer contained two small pics and i didn't have <strong>"Enough Reputation Points"</strong>. So now my question is, <strong>"How to raise my Reputation points?"</strong></p>

				<p>Asking questions or answering questions increase your reputation. If someone upvotes your question you'll have enough reputation ;)</p>

			<div id = "comment-2927" class = "comment">
				<p>Try to answer your question without the pics -- I know it might take an extra thousand words or so ;-)</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "comment-2929" class = "comment">
				<p>Put external links to the images - someone with enough rep will edit the question to put the images in the question</p>

				<p><p>The system restricts image embeds and multiple URL posts until you've gotten a few votes. This reduces the time needed to clean up after people that enjoy posting pictures of genetalia anonymously and such. </p>

<p>You can still upload a picture to any picture sharing site and paste the URL Into your question. Just add a comment aski someone to embed the picture and usually that happens within hours as most people are very helpful in editing new user's questions. </p>

<p>The [faq] covers reputation and how to earn it in many ways. Some easy ones are answering, making a helpful/substantial edit to a post or just asking a useful, well worded question. </p>

<p>Hopefully you figure some ways to answer and get votes. </p>

<p>Welcome to the site :)</p>
