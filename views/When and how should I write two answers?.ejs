				<h2>When and how should I write two answers?</h2>
<p>For certain questions, there may be multiple ways of doing something. This is the question that persuaded me to write this:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/127716/fastest-way-to-get-a-photo-from-iphone-to-mac">Fastest way to get a photo from iPhone to Mac?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>My existing answer is a way to get the photo to the Mac over Photo Stream using a folder. However, I also have a second way, completely unrelated to Photo Stream yet still a very quick way to transfer photos.</p>

<p>How should I include this second answer? Should I edit my existing answer to include a second answer, in this way:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Photo Stream method</h3>
  
  <p>[content]</p>
  
  <h3>App method</h3>
  
  <p>[content]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alternatively, should I write a second answer?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[content mentioning Photo Stream method]</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>[content mentioning app method]</p>
</blockquote>

<p> and if so, should I introduce the answers with a title?</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Photo Stream method</h3>
  
  <p>[content]</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <h3>App method</h3>
  
  <p>[content]</p>
</blockquote>

				<p>In short, don't sweat it.  I have used both methods.  Sometimes I choose which is most appropriate based on the particular wording of the question, so in this instance is says "What's the fastest way", well if I have two ways, only one can be fastest <em>to me</em>, but someone else may find the other one faster.  In this case I might present multiple answers.  If it was worded <em>is there a fast way to..</em> then I might include them both in one.</p>

<p>There's no hard and fast rule, it's just what you feel is appropriate.  If, for example I have an answer that has votes, and maybe even an accept, and I come up with an alternate way some time down the line, it's a little disingenuous to edit it in to the existing answer, so I would normally add another, for example.</p>
