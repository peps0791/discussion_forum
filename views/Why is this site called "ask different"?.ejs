<p>I'm using a Mac right now to post this. And I'm not "different".</p>

<p>So why is this site called "Ask Different"?  In my opinion, it kind of sounds like you think Mac users are somehow "different", and this is alienating, in a way.</p>

<p>Plus what if the Mac user market shot up to 25% over a few years, for some weird reason?  Would we be "asking different" then, or "asking mainstream?"</p>

<p>I just don't think it's nice to call Mac users "Different".  Different from what? The mainstream?  Do you have to highlight it this way?  May be viewed as <em>marginally</em> offensive. </p>

				<p>Ask Different is a play on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_different" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Think Different</a> ad campaign that Apple ran in the '90s.</p>

<p>The Ask part just represents one of the site's core functions, asking.</p>

<p>The goal is in no way to label Apple users as somehow different; it's just a bit of nostalgia.</p>
