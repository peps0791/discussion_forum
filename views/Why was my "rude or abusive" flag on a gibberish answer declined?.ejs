				<h2>Why was my "rude or abusive" flag on a gibberish answer declined?</h2>
<p>I flagged <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/221565/siri-can-not-activate-some-alarms-on-iphone-6s-plus-with-ios-9-2/249610#249610">this answer</a> (now deleted, <a href="https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/post/37412" rel="nofollow noreferrer">metasmoke link for &lt;10kers</a>) as "rude or abusive". It was declined with a comment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please use other. Abusive is to track intentional malice towards people and not simple vandalism,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/58032/what-are-the-spam-and-rude-or-abusive-offensive-flags-and-how-do-they-wor/58035#58035">FAQ answer on What are the  spam  and  rude or abusive  (offensive) flags, and how do they work?</a> says that posts that contains only gibberish should be flagged as "rude or abusive".</p>

				<p>I have had a look at your links and you clearly flagged that post correctly. I handled the flag incorrectly - for that I apologize.</p>

<p>Worse, I had dismissed some other similar flags to yours - I'm not sure when/how I got the idea that rude and abusive needed a personal aspect, but it's pretty clear that <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/58032/what-are-the-spam-and-rude-or-abusive-offensive-flags-and-how-do-they-wor/58035#58035">gibberish should be flagged as abuse</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for pointing out my error so I don't keep making it.</p>
