(These are things that people, starting from Jeff Atwood, seem to keep repeating even though what Ive seen in practice at several SE sites doesnt necessarily support them at all...)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Dont scale</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some truth to it, but not <em>quite</em> so. The fact is that SE software is not <em>optimal</em> for polls with hundreds of answers, but it still <em>works</em>. Nothing crashes; new answers can be added; good stuff still is at the top; bad stuff gets down to the bottom. <em>How exactly</em> does it not scale?</p>\n\n<p>Sure, no-one reads <a href=\"https://superuser.com/questions/1191/what-are-some-must-have-mac-os-x-programs\">all of the 157 answers</a> to a poll about OS X programs at one sitting. So what? It can still <strong>very useful</strong>, for example to a person new to OS X who goes through the first 2-3 pages and find plenty of great ideas of what to install!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Noise\" - detract from more serious\n  questions</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is probably the strongest argument of those four. Big polls keep popping up on the front page with new answers and edits. Still: it is quite easy to ignore questions you dont like (but others like very much) and move on with your life. If a tag such as <code>[poll]</code> is used, those who want can even hide them completely. </p>\n\n<p>Even then polls would affect how <em>newcomers</em> perceive the site, right? Well yes, but not in any untruthful way. Dont worry about it too much. People are generally smart and benevolent enough (which is why Stack Overflow works, by the way).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Often are time restricted (become stale quickly)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some people love to repeat this, but fortunately it is not true at all. <strong>Community wiki polls on SE can stay perfectly dynamic, alive and up-to-date</strong>. This can be achieved with some active pruning and a couple of key features in the software platform. These features are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The voting system</strong>. Good stuff goes up, bad stuff (including duplicates and other worthless posts) goes down.</li>\n<li><strong>Ability to add new answers</strong>. </li>\n<li><strong>Ability to edit answers</strong> (by any trusted users)  </li>\n<li>Ability to delete answers \n\n<ul>\n<li>People who posted duplicates usually did it unwittingly, and can often be persuaded to remove such zero-value-adding posts</li>\n<li>Not as crucial, but still useful: moderators can prune away downvoted duplicates and other crap from the bottom, if they want to.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Ability to sort answers by votes <em>and</em> by date</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A couple of <strong>use cases</strong>, with the <a href=\"https://superuser.com/questions/1191/what-are-some-must-have-mac-os-x-programs\">Mac application poll</a> as an example.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1)</strong> Lets say a new OS X app is released, 2 years after the poll was created. The app is absolutely fantastic. Someone goes on and adds an answer about it. Ok, it now has 0 votes and sits at the bottom. Does it get buried behind all the mediocre stuff? <strong>No.</strong> (Unless it deserves to.) Many knowledgeable users use the \"newest\" ordering when returning to look a poll question, and if they see good new stuff, they vote it up. If the new app truly is great, it will reach the first page in a few days or weeks, even if the poll has 6 to 8 pages of answers! </p>\n\n<p>If you dont believe me on that one, I can dig up evidence e.g. from some gigantic Stack Overflow poll; Ive seen it happen often enough.</p>\n\n<p>Its sort of sad to see those useful questions (some of the communitys most-liked questions, actually!) on Super User <a href=\"https://meta.superuser.com/questions/915/should-this-popular-cw-question-be-unlocked-to-allow-it-to-evolve\">locked</a> because <em>that</em> is exactly what kills them and makes them stale (no new answers can be added).</p>\n\n<p><strong>2)</strong> Lets say a relatively highly-voted app (e.g. Google Chrome) gets a slew of new features, transforming the key essence of that app (say, Google engineers pushed the limits further and it does your laundry now). This affects peoples opinions about the app, and our poll is suddenly all stale and obsolete, right? Well, no. Someone goes and edits the CW answer to mention this key fact. It gets votes from new users and moves higher in the list. Those who dont like the new version of the app can change their former upvote to downvote. (Ok, this Chrome example is suboptimal; maybe Ill come up with a better one later.)</p>\n\n<p>Such adaptation to changed world will always take <em>some</em> time, but in the bigger scheme of things it doesnt matter. Like Wikipedia, these things can mostly be self-healing and self-updating if you just let them (i.e. dont lock them!) and if you do just a little bit of curating every now and then.</p>\n\n<h2>Examples of great poll questions</h2>\n\n<p>Finally, for reference and as examples, below are links to some <em>good</em> polls.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>SF: <a href=\"https://serverfault.com/q/3780/1746\"><strong>Useful Command-line Commands on Windows</strong></a>   Nice showcase of a well-executed poll. </li>\n<li>Apple SE: <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/400/150\"><strong>Mac OS X hidden features</strong></a>   Im happy that <a href=\"http://twitter.com/spolsky/status/24493360648\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Joel seems to appreciate</a> a good poll (and sees their value in promoting SE), even if <a href=\"https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/57226/56285\">Jeff is still against them</a> almost categorically.</li>\n<li>SU: <a href=\"https://superuser.com/q/1241/2984\"><strong> Must have  Windows programs?</strong></a>   Shame that its been <a href=\"https://meta.superuser.com/q/915/2984\">\"killed\" by locking it</a> for no good reason at all. :-(</li>\n<li>SO: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/101268/\"><strong>Hidden features of Python</strong></a>   Considered useful by <em>many</em> people, as you can see.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That last one boasts a new (to me, at least) feature:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>protected</strong> by Will  Jul 16 at 2:54</p>\n  \n  <p>This question is protected to prevent\n  \"thanks!\", \"me too!\", or spam answers\n  by new users.

(Also, if Apple SE actually was \"Mac / OS X only\", that would mean there was no need for it in the first place, as Mac and OS X are perfectly on-topic at <a href=\"https://superuser.com/\">Super User</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>If you consider <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com\">Stack Overflow</a>, is it becoming \"disjointed\" with the huge influx of questions on Ruby or Python that the average C# programmer really doesnt have much interest in? By the way, <a href=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/merging-season/\">Spolsky discusses</a> the SE scope issue in the latest blog entry; interesting read.</p>\n\n<p>Bottom line: if you dont care much about iOS related questions, you can easily ignore them. (You can tweak your prefs so that you dont even <em>see</em> those questions, if you want to.) I dont think merging in those questions does harm to the community, at least in the long run.</p>\n','150','-1',NULL,'2017-03-20T10:04:26.767','2010-09-20T10:47:31.397',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL),(121,'1',NULL,NULL,'2010-09-22T02:38:05.480',2,145,'<p>Ive been working on the tag list lately, trying to standardize the format and clean up confusion.

Imagine the user who will never read your FAQ and you have two seconds to grab their attention. It should be catchy but descriptive. It should be thoroughly clear but painfully concise. <strong>Make every... word... count.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Here are some creative examples: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://gawker.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gawker</a>: Daily Manhattan media news and gossip. Reporting live from the center of the universe. </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gizmodo</a>: The gadget guide.

Mmmm whipped cream. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Use it as a Tagline</h2>\n\n<p>A shorter elevator pitch <em>can</em> be used as a tagline&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;something you can display in the header at the top of the page. If it doesnt fit, consider shortening it or creating a separate tagline. Here are some great examples: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://slashdot.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Slashdot</a>: News for nerds. Stuff that matters. </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.lifehacker.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lifehacker</a>: Don t live to geek, geek to live! </li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.thesimpledollar.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Simple Dollar</a>: Financial talk for the rest of us. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The Motto (dont forget <a href=\"https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/107/what-should-our-logo-and-site-design-be-like\">your logo</a>)</h2>\n\n<p>A logo begs for it own little, short tagline&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;like a motto. Maybe the tagline inspires the logo; Maybe its the other way around. Mottos make good t-shirt, bumper stickers, and other marketing material. Either way, youll recognize a good motto when you see it: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Just do it. </li>\n<li>Think Different. </li>\n<li>The Uncola. </li>\n<li>Intel inside. </li>\n<li>Like a rock. </li>\n<li>The king of beers. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&hellip;and perhaps all this leads to a proper name and domain for your site&hellip; <em>eventually</em>.

Either theres a bug, or there has been a change in what questions contribute towards that figure.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming theres a bug, though, we still only have 12.8 questions per day, so we still need to get that ramped up - were about 300 questions short right now.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Weve passed 1500 questions and are now at 3 \"excellents\":</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/P6Y6c.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Also of note, weve crossed over 2k visits/day and we have 38 more users with 200+ rep and 2 more users with 2k+ rep. We still need:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>5 more users with 200+ rep</li>\n<li>3 more with 2k+ rep</li>\n<li>4 more with 3k+ rep</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>as well as increasing our answer ratio to 2.5 answers per question.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As many of you probably know, Area 51 has a set of metrics it uses to evaluate the progress of the sites in public beta:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/x4G5T.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Weve always had an \"excellent\" percent answered, and as you can see weve recently crossed the 1500 visits/day \"excellent\" threshold as well. Now Id like to see what we can do to address the rest of the metrics to bring them up to \"excellent\":</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Number of questions</strong> should be pretty easy - at the current rate, we should hit 1500 questions in a little over a week.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Number of \"avid users\"</strong> is going to be harder. In order to get \"excellent\" in this category, we need to have 42 additional users with 200+ rep, 5 additional with 2,000+ rep, and 4 more with 5,000+ rep. To hit these targets, well need to</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Actively recruit more users to the site. Suggestions about how to do this are welcome.</p></li>\n<li><p>Questions, and especially answers, need to get more votes to increase the rep of the poster. We need to actively promote upvoting good questions and answers.</p></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p><strong>Answer ratio</strong> could also be tricky. In order to bring our existing question base up to a ratio of 2.5 answers per question wed have to add over 420 answers (give or take, the ratio isnt precise). Of course, getting some answers to the 6% \"unanswered\" questions should be the top priority, but we should try to encourage users to add alternative solutions to \"answered\" questions as well.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thoughts?</p>\n','13','-1',NULL,'2017-04-13T12:45:27.673','2011-01-29T07:20:55.940',NULL,'2011-01-29T07:22:28.373','Going from \"okay\" to \"excellent\"','<discussion><stackexchange><users>',1,11,NULL,NULL),(188,'2','187',NULL,'2010-11-28T04:00:28.183',5,NULL,'<p>Lurking around discussions.apple.com and posting  links  to this site might help.

For questions, following the guidelines in the FAQ and the great subjective questions post will probably keep away the close votes.</p>\n\n<h3>Questions</h3>\n\n<p>Even if someone absolutely loathes the software theyre asking the question about, theres no reason the question cant be made objective and the commentary left out. Rants belong on chat, meta, or (sparingly) the comments.  Putting this kind of rhetoric in the question only serves to create a negative atmosphere.  Even if there is a legitimate question hiding beneath the commentary, people tend to see it as a rant and arguments ensue.</p>\n\n<h3>Answers</h3>\n\n<p>I think sometimes a user has a strong opinion about whether a particular approach is the right way to solve a problem, and then they share that opinion as an \"answer\", even though their post is really just criticism of the idea presented in the question.  </p>\n\n<p>Many times I think the information in these answers could be valuable to the topic... but I strongly disagree that just because something is related and provides value that it should be an \"answer\".  </p>\n\n<p>If a post is trying to persuade, its a comment(ary).  Maybe the comment will change the OPs mind about the issue, in which case the question could be edited.  However, it seems that some people just ignore what the OP wants and post what they think they should want.</p>\n\n<p>For stuff that really should be shared even though it doesnt answer the question, I would say try to fit it in one or two comments first. Use an answer only as a last resort when some information absolutely will not fit in a comment post (or two).</p>\n\n<p>\"I dont think so\", or \"No, it cant be done\" are not answers to a question, and should be comments...  Unless the question is actually something along the lines of \"Can x be done?\", posting \"No\" as an answer without any evidence isnt very helpful IMO.  You cant <strong>prove</strong> a negative, but you can at least provide some reasoning (links, references, alternatives) so it doesnt come off as personal opinion in those cases where its pretty clear that there is currently no solution.</p>\n\n<h3>Why I think this matters</h3>\n\n<p>I dont want to see negativity seeping into the community.  I dont want to see holy-wars, and I think allowing this kind of stuff to start even at a small level hurts the site.  If people start to get it in their head that their questions will be criticized, theyll go elsewhere seeking solutions.  </p>\n\n<p>Personally, I plan to continue utilizing the answer to comment moderator tool whenever I encounter blatant examples of commentary disguised as answers.  Ive actually been pretty conservative about it and left a lot of posts that I think fall into this category but werent extremely blatant.  Its not like the posts are being deleted, the information is still there.  If the person who posted it disagrees, they can always create a new post that actually answers the question, or flag it for review, post on meta, chat, etc... </p>\n\n<p>As an aside, I have personal experience with <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1588/is-there-are-place-to-report-missing-incorrect-album-art-to-the-itunes-team\">posting commentary as an \"answer\"</a>.  It only succeeded in ticking off the OP.  I quickly regretted posting it in the first place.  My \"answer\" received an upvote, but personally I dont feel it or the reputation I gained from it is deserved.  The only reason I didnt delete it at the time was because I felt it provided some good information related to the topic and it was too long to be a comment.

Im <a href=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/our-designer-in-residence-jin-yang/\">Jin</a>, and Ill be working on the designs for the Stack Exchange sites as they graduate from the beta phase. Each site will have its own unique theme that will reflect its topic. However, all sites will share quite a bit of common elements so they feel like theyre part of the Stack Exchange family.</p>\n\n<p>First, I want to say an early congrats for the upcoming launch of Apple.stackexchange.com. Thank you for being an awesome community!</p>\n\n<p>As an Apple user myself, Ive always appreciated Apples designs in UI and hardware. I think what makes Apples design stand out is that they pay great attention to detail. Apple draws a fine balance between eye-candy and simplistic elegance. </p>\n\n<p>The design goal for our Apple site is to maintain the branding of the Stack Exchange Q&amp;A family, something youre familiar with from using the Beta site, or other SE sites. At the same time, the design needs to give this community its own identity thats associated with Apple. For new users to the site, the design should invoke that \"Apple\" feeling right away.</p>\n\n<p>I had a great pleasure working with <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/flyosity\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mike Rundle</a>, the talented designer who provided me with the initial mockups. I have since tweaked his designs a bit. I believe the designs below work well and represent what this site is about.</p>\n\n<p><em>(click on images to see full resolution versions)</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rPKZH.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rPKZH.png\" alt=\"AppleSE homepage design\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hUCvY.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hUCvY.png\" alt=\"AppleSE Question design\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Im aiming to have the site launched later this week, in time for the <a href=\"http://www.macworldexpo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Macworld Expo</a>. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> heres the publicity card we designed to be handed out at MacworldExpo:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rEsd6.png\" alt=\"AppleSE card design\"></p>\n','6',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2011-02-09T21:25:34.490',NULL,NULL,'Design for the Apple StackExchange site','<discussion><design>',8,22,9,NULL),(269,'2','268',NULL,'2011-01-26T02:41:42.267',12,NULL,'<p>The design looks great, I have a few suggestions if youre open to them. Theyre small things, but I know that \"small\" doesnt always mean \"easy to change\". :)</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>On most of the other SE sites, the ask button is separated and more distinct from the rest of the top navigation, usually a different color. Is there a way we could get it to stand out more?</li>\n<li>Would it be possible for the sidebar to maybe look more like a drawer? I.e. something like <a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7KUjt.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a>?</li>\n<li>Im not crazy about the yellow gradient behind the question title (and it wouldnt work if the sidebar became a drawer) and it looks like it might not handle long titles well.

Similar to above, I think it would look perfect if the \"word\" links (logout, chat, etc) moved over to the left like the Mac menubar, and any icon based links would be on the right.  Maybe even put a mini version of the clover logo on the top left? :)</p></li>\n<li><p>I 100% agree with Kyle on the tags thing...

It would disrupt the whole website look (in comparison to other SE sites). </p></li>\n<li><p>The \"ASK Question\" (and the whole line) deserves some attention, its too subtle and sites like Ubuntu have a very distinctive \"ask\", separated from the rest. However Cooking has a single line, all the same color. Im not sure which one is better, but I am sure that the current implementation in those designs is not very easy to read. \nWe could use something from the Finder itself: \n<img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/AMXfO.jpg\" alt=\"finder\">\nIf anything, the disclose triangles would help.</p></li>\n<li><p>The yellow/greenish/iTunes gradient in the title question: I like it, at least at first. It remains to be seen how would that work for a longer title and/or what happens if its made a little bit smaller/non bold. I like how it gives the Apple look. Id probably try using iTunes colors tho. As ugly as iTunes may be, its some sort of \"visual trademark\".</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Compare: \n<img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5A2Rz.jpg\" alt=\"iTunes\"></p>\n\n<p>vs</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BIh1c.jpg\" alt=\"AppleSE\"></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The envelope: A few sites still use them, but there are some notable exceptions, like Askubuntu, which uses an @. I dont know about this. :s</p></li>\n<li><p>Tags: I believe tags could be tweaked to look like Mac tags. There are numerous examples around. For example, taken from \"<a href=\"http://culturedcode.com/things/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Things</a>\":</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/s7ezd.jpg\" alt=\"things tags\"></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Completely agree that the Stackexchange icon/logo is hard to read with the current colors.

Lower case wins. Ignored Tags style too.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>A few contributions of my own</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Answer editor, has a black background in the toolbar, it looks \"cool\" but has nothing to do with Apples applications or Cocoa. Id like an idea more oriented towards a standard Cocoa app, that \"blends\" with the text:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GCvZG.jpg\" alt=\"pages\"></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The \"Post Your Answer\" button is ok too, but should be on the right. Mac users are used to button alignment \"the right way\"  ;)</p></li>\n<li><p>The \"Answered\" box (green) should be the same color as the \"iTunes\" thing we mentioned earlier. That green might look nice, but has nothing to do there. The orange, blue, black, gray, makes it look too full of colors. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>The design looks neat and even if we dont change anything, its very nice and I really like it. Would love to be able to \"use\" it to see how it feels. Thanks for including a question where my name appears :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>And wheres Apple?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>As pointed by Am1rr3zA, the only caveat is that by \"just\" looking at that, theres no indication whatsoever that this is a place for asking questions about Apple. The cloverleaf is nice, but not immediately associated with Apple (unless you are an Apple user already) but Windows users using Apple products, have no   in their computers and/or keyboards. Perhaps the mailbox icon could be replaced with a little Apple? ;-)</p>\n\n<p>@Jin, great work. @All of us, gratz for what weve accomplished so far and thanks to @jeff and company for all their hard work.

Congratulations! Also thank you for the <a href=\"https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/268/design-for-the-apple-stackexchange-site\">feedback</a> on the initial design. I was able to make some changes based on your input, and I think theres still room for fine tuning. </p>\n\n<p>I have to say converting the Apple.se design to CSS has been quite a challenge for me, its probably the hardest SE site Ive done so far. (All the SE sites use the same HTML code base on Stackoverflow.com.). There are still some known glitches which Ill iron out tonight and this weekend. I know the formatting of the tag-related sections are a bit off, and so are some Moderator pages. </p>\n\n<p>I used quite a bit of CSS3 during the conversion. According to our web stats, nearly 87% of you use CSS3 capable browsers. The site should degrade gracefully with older browsers.</p>\n\n<p>If you see any other styling issues, please start a new question and tag it with [design] and [bug] instead of replying to this post. That way I can track your bug reports easily.</p>\n\n<p>If youre still seeing the old favicons, load the follow 2 urls in your browser and hard refresh:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://sstatic.net/apple/img/favicon.ico\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://sstatic.net/apple/img/favicon.ico</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://sstatic.net/applemeta/img/favicon.ico\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://sstatic.net/applemeta/img/favicon.ico</a></p>\n\n<p>Once again, congrats!</p>\n','6','-1',NULL,'2017-03-16T15:45:18.873','2011-01-29T03:12:54.877',NULL,NULL,'New Design Launched','<discussion><design>',1,5,2,NULL),(292,'1',NULL,'315','2011-01-29T00:01:32.777',1,82,'<p>The number inside the red badge for featured questions is not aligned correctly:\n<img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aconI.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n','732','6',NULL,'2011-01-30T23:26:10.447','2011-01-30T23:26:10.447',NULL,NULL,'Cosmetic bug in new theme','<status-completed><design><bug>',1,1,NULL,NULL),(293,'1',NULL,'296','2011-01-29T01:22:55.687',8,128,'<p>I understand that launched sites require more rep for a given privilege, but it feels pretty unfair that Ive now lost a bunch of my capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>I think it would be much friendlier to let beta users grandfather in to these privileges because, really, losing stuff sucks.

Too heavy, too cluttered. I would suggest removing the high contrast boxes around the answers and sidebar. Use a simple light background that differentiate from the \"paper\" texture. Keep all the sweet details in the GUI: the buttons, the tags, the icons, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Typography: Im really a beginner there, but my feel is that the fonts are \"monochromatic\": the font size is too similar throughout the page. I think the design could use two contrasting types. Maybe one for titles and one for body.</p>\n\n<p>The CC button at the bottom right seems to get far more highlight than it should relative to the rest of the content. I would have imagined it as subdued, flat, and really out of the way (ie. iconic).</p>\n\n<p>Likewise for the logo icon. I like the COMMAND key symbol in the logo, but I feel the extra \"recessed\" border around it makes it heavy and cluttered. A simple drop shadow (basically the inner \"button\" in the symbol) would be sufficient.</p>\n\n<p>The search box top right is a little thin and could use more vertical inner space.</p>\n\n<p>Since the Design is heavily influenced by the Apple GUI, Ill try to find some comparisons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The apple.com homepage: all the background is light (good), so that the main content really comes forward. Here, the main content is boxed into thick contrasting borders which feel really heavy and make it hard to separate the content from the design.</li>\n<li>Note the main box on the apple.com homepage is a lighter color than the texture background, white, no texture. I think that would be best here. It would be a lot easier to read through the answers. It would \"breathe\" more.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Also, use more colour. I think thats an element of Apples website design: contrasting the colours with the site layout which is essentially monochromatic.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: Im not a designer, and I know its easier to critique than do it. I appreciate the design work but with the best intentions, I just wanted to point out that the design is, all things considered, less \"usable\" (in terms of readability and conciseness) than the simple StackOverflow design. The ideal design imho would be to stop adding CSS3 cruft and remove things one by one until you get middle way between the sweet OS X inspired GUI, and the simplicity and lightness of the original StackOverflow design.</p>\n\n<p>Designs that <em>I find</em> more readable:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ProWebmasters : could use a little differentiaton in background, or maybe a nice thin vertical line between body and sidebar, to guide the eye, but otherwise easy to read, which is what matters most on this type of site.</li>\n<li>Game development : use the white background for body text, no boxes around answers (just simple lines, or dotted lines separation)</li>\n</ul>\n','1634','1634',NULL,'2011-02-09T21:25:34.490','2011-02-09T21:25:34.490',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL),(374,'1',NULL,NULL,'2011-02-13T00:32:36.577',1,78,'<p>The skin here is really messing with my eyes, and Im having trouble understanding what I see when on this SE site, when compared to others.</p>\n\n<p>Id like to request an option to turn off the skin and revert to a default, un-skinned site (maybe similar to the beta sites)</p>\n','3579',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2011-04-16T17:41:43.627',NULL,NULL,'An option to turn off the skin (revert to something like the default \"beta\" skin for sites)','<feature-request>',1,0,1,NULL),(375,'1',NULL,'376','2011-02-13T18:52:47.607',4,58,'<p>Im confused.

As an example, for our initial launch I posted about it on multiple Apple sites around the internet, Reddit, and Hacker News. I even emailed Lifehacker to see if they were interested in doing it. That said, I think that its much more important to try and get the community to promote the site. Theres only so much a single moderator can do, but if you have a solid core of regular users that can promote the site organically, then theres a much better chance for it to succeed.</p>\n\n<p><strong><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9904b127bff836c939152dcd300ea9ea?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG\" alt=\"VxJasonxV\"> <a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/798/vxjasonxv\">VxJasonxV</a> <a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/596808#596808\">expanded</a>:</strong> @Josh I dont know that I call it a responsibility to bring traffic to the site, but it is commitment to do so.

The SEO for Stack Exchange is very effective, and its the role of moderators to ensure that the quality of the questions and answers make the SEO successful. Obviously promoting the site in general should be done, but that can be expected from anyone that is a user on the site.</p>\n','1521',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2011-03-02T16:32:39.650',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL),(411,'2','408',NULL,'2011-03-02T16:34:00.290',0,NULL,'<h2><em><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3981cd271c302f5cba628c6b6d2b32ee?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG\" alt=\"Tim Stone\"> <a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/166/tim-stone\">Tim Stone</a> <a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/596805#596805\">asked</a>:</em> Moderation requires decisive action.

Before the day was done, as a result of key communication events (users responding to Joels announcement on Twitter claiming the domain name \"conveyed no meaning\").</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the logo was reverted from the pointed \"Nothing to Install\", to the boring \"Web Applications\" one. The theme/color scheme, etc. remained the same. Instead of webapps.stackexchange.com redirecting to nothingtoinstall.com , nothingtoinstall.com redirected to webapps.stackexchange.com , and a couple flamewars and huge discussions broke out (among more sensible ones too). On meta.webapps and meta.so.</p>\n\n<p>Needless to say, since that day, while every(?) graduate has a cute name associated with it, and likely an actual domain name, none of them get a non-generic title to go with it<sup>1</sup>.

The other changes are minor, mostly text and link colors changes to go with the new lighter background color.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few reasons why I made the design changes:</p>\n\n<p>1) The old 2-tone background design was pretty painful to implement in CSS. I had to write a lot more extra CSS hacks to get the pages to look right. Even then, some pages still didnt look nice because of the HTML structure. The old design caused the CSS file to be very bloated and hard to maintain, also its not easily adaptable for new site features/pages in the future.</p>\n\n<p>2) In the old design I used quite a bit of CSS3 elements for the parent container, this caused some browser performance issues(namely scrolling smoothness in Firefox and Safari).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Deegp.png\" alt=\"OSX Lion UI inspirations\"></p>\n\n<p>3) The old design was inspired by iOS Apps look. After the site launched, I felt the dark backgrounds made the site a bit too boxy. Dark trims work on an iOS device because screen size is fixed. Ive been looking at the new OSX Lion UI elements and I think theyre better fitted for a web site design. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, the new changes may have produced a few newer glitches. Mostly likely text colors.

Experience leads me to believe this is partially due to \"long code example bias\" (it is much longer and looks more \"complete\" than the other answers), and comments lead me to believe it is partially because people like the \"hack\" it provides, without regard to how it answers the question.</p>\n\n<p>*** When I say that the answer Im referring to doesnt answer the question very well (even if its being answered literally), its because it presents a very convoluted way to provide only a little security by obscurity.  Its a \"swiss cheese\" security solution, and judging by all the \"caveats\" at the end of the authors answer, the author seems to be aware of this, too.</p>\n\n<p><strong>For those who arent familiar with OS X user/file security, following the steps in this answer would be like locking your front door and hiding your housekey under your front doormat.</strong>  Most people arent even going to <em>approach</em> your house, but if you actually have reasons to worry about the ones that do, it would be trivial for them to find the key and gain easy access to your house without you knowing about it.  Its like saying <em>\"please dont look in here...but I cant stop you if you really want to\"</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Normally I would trust that the best answers will rise to the top, but in this case, Im worried that the \"long code example bias\" that I mentioned above might prevent this.  (If youve hung around Stack Overflow enough, Im sure youve seen this happen many times.  And I would bet that non-programmers are even more susceptible to this bias.)  Even though I <em>knew</em> there were major problems with the answer, I still felt bad downvoting it -- mainly because it was long, and it was clear the author spent a decent amount of time on it.</p>\n\n<p>There is also the fact that, given the relatively small population of users on Ask Different, it is not common for even a <em>great</em> answer to get 4 upvotes in a matter of hours.  What would be a small margin on SO or SU is a much wider rift on this site.</p>\n\n<p>I think we can probably agree that Ask Different generally attracts a greater percentage of unexperienced computer users than the \"hardcore\" sites like SO, SU, SF, Programmers SE, and Security SE.  Am I just being over-protective worrying that someone might come across this question, see this top-voted answer, and not realize that it provides roughly <em>zilch</em> in the way of <em>real</em> security -- and in fact, may even be detrimental to the security of their system?</p>\n\n<p><code>&lt;/more-details&gt;</code></p>\n\n<p>Thanks for reading this far!

Adding to this that <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id422352214?mt=12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Xcode</a> and the <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/index.action\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Developer Previews of Lion</a> are distributed via the Mac App Store, we consider how Apple may distribute Lion officially, possibly announcing it this summer at WWDC.</p></li>\n<li><p>Our Question of the Week is  <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/14013/is-there-a-way-to-password-protect-individual-apps/\">Is There a Way to Password Protect Individual Apps</a> , asked by <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/698/rabskatran\">Rabskatran</a>.

That means that you now have the choice to use a Google, Facebook, other OpenID provider to login, or create a traditional e-mail and password login, in order to have your OpenID hosted by Stack Exchange. We also discuss the strict requirements that Stack Exchange places on the password for an account. We debate whether or not they are necessary or reasonable, and how they compare with the practices of both other sites and users.</p></li>\n<li><p>With WWDC around the corner, Kyle brings us another piece of site news: the unofficial Stack Exchange WWDC meetup. Any developers who use Stack Exchange should drop by Eddie Rickenbackers on June 7th. <a href=\"https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/533/unofficial-stackexchange-wwdc-meet-up-7th-june-2011\">Click here for more info</a>.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>On a related note, as none of us can make it to WWDC, we put forth a request: We would love to have someone who goes to WWDC be present on a show to talk about their experience.

We share two apps, <a href=\"http://www.hddfancontrol.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HDD Fan Control</a> ($10) and <a href=\"http://www.eidac.de/?p=134\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">smcFanControl</a> (free) that regulate the iMac s fan speed so that you can use a third-party hard drive without listening to constant, unnecessary fan noise.</p></li>\n<li><p>We discuss the current state of Apple hardware and what refreshes should be on the horizon. For one, we expect to see Thunderbolt make its way onto many of the Apple machines that do not yet support it. Macrumors.com <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/2011/04/21/apple-developing-narrower-rackmountable-mac-pro-prototypes/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">predicts that</a> the Mac Pro will be updated with a rack-mountable form factor, and we expect it to have multiple Thunderbolt ports. Will the inclusion of Mac OS X Server in Lion mean a refresh for the Mac mini server and increased server-oriented capabilities on the Mac Pro? Will the plastic MacBooks be discontinued altogether?</p></li>\n<li><p>In other news, the Mac security world has been shaken up these past few weeks by a new Mac trojan called MacDefender, which is one of the first major pieces of malware written for the Mac. We talk about how one can become infected, what the malware does, and how to remove it, and we discuss Apple s  promised upcoming software update that will eliminate this particular threat. With that in mind, we discuss the state of Mac security and where it may go in the future. Will the App Store become, by default, the only way to install software on your Mac? Will Apple continue protect us from threats with software updates?  </p></li>\n<li><p>Apple is celebrating their 10th anniversary of the opening of Apple Retail Stores. In doing so they ve <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/22/apple-store-celebrates-10th-anniversary-with-2-0-experience-ipa/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">rolled out some very significant upgrades for their stores</a>. Almost all paper in the store is gone, replaced by a fleet of iPads. iPads are placed next to every hardware product in the store (yes, even iPads) in order to serve as an interactive kiosk for product information, and for a few personal store functions. This spurns a longer discussion on how a similar system would benefit another type of business.</p></li>\n<li><p>Amazon has announced and released the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/m2VSWB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mac Download Store</a>. Amazon s store features many key retail titles for immediate digital download, similar to the Mac App Store. The difference is that everything takes place through amazon.com in any web browser, then a tailored Amazon software downloader manages retrieving and installing the software after purchase. Amazon s store features Microsoft Office for Mac, much of Adobe s Creative Suite (individually packaged), and more.</p></li>\n<li><p>Our main topic is the pending litigation between <a href=\"http://www.lodsys.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lodsys, LLC</a>, and various iOS app developers.

We discuss new App Store features in Lion and highlight the success that apps like <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator/id407963104?mt=12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pixelmator</a> have had in the store.</p></li>\n<li><p>Following up on our <a href=\"https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/517/podcast-2-rim-playbook-continuous-client-coda\">earlier discussion</a> of the idea of the <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2010/05/26/a-modest-proposal-the-continuous-client/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Continuous Client</a>, we discuss how it ties in with Lions upcoming support for saving and resuming app state, autosave, and versioning of files.</p></li>\n<li><p>We wrap up our discussion of Lion by talking about AirDrop, a way to drag and drop files from one Mac to another without needing to configure file sharing, and the \"iPadification\" of the new interface for the Mail app.</p></li>\n<li><p>Apple also previewed some new features of the next version of iOS, iOS 5, starting with a completely redesigned notifications interface. We discuss whats different and how it makes it easier to read and manage multiple simultaneous notifications.</p></li>\n<li><p>Twitter is now deeply integrated into iOS, and features a single sign-on area in the settings. We discuss what this means for Twitter, third-party Twitter clients, and the conspicuous absence of Facebook.</p></li>\n<li><p>Mobile Safari has also seen multiple improvements, including a tab bar and an <a href=\"http://www.instapaper.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Instapaper</a>-like Reading List feature. Theres also a new to-do list app called Reminders. We discuss whether the tab bar was a good idea and the usefulness of location-based reminder alerts.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Camera app has undergone significant improvement. We talk about the faster loading time, the ability to quickly take a picture without having to unlock your device, and how the volume button has even been configured to act as a shutter button!</p></li>\n<li><p>The requirement to activate an iOS device through iTunes will soon be a thing of the past - iOS 5 has cut the cord and is PC-Free. We discuss what the benefit is, and how iOS has made it possible.</p></li>\n<li><p>Apple has brought its Messages app to the iPad and iPod touch, and theyve renamed it... iMessages? Yes, its true - we discuss use cases, the similarity to <a href=\"http://us.blackberry.com/apps-software/blackberrymessenger/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Blackberrys BBM</a> service, and cringe at how bad the name is.</p></li>\n<li><p>Move aside Mac, Apple has re-envisioned the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9046oXrm7f8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">digital hub</a> and it now centers around iCloud. <a href=\"http://www.me.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MobileMe</a> is being phased out as well, and the Contacts, Calendars, and Mail services are being absorbed into iCloud.</p></li>\n<li><p>iCloud also offers a cloud-based backup service for iOS devices, allowing users to back up and restore without ever needing to involve a computer. We discuss the benefits of this, and the limitations Apple has placed on it.</p></li>\n<li><p>Purchases made through the App Store, iBooks Store, and iTunes Store are catalogued in one place and can be downloaded and re-downloaded to all the devices on your Apple account. We discuss our disappointment at the lack of a facility to stream music, and how the new price point - <em>free</em> - is sure to drive adoption.</p></li>\n<li><p>One More Thing... iTunes Match. For $24.99/year, you can have iCloud scan your iTunes library for music that had not been purchased through the iTunes Store. If the iTunes Store carries the file, you will be upgraded to a high-quality version. If not, iTunes will upload it to iCloud and offer the standard iTunes in the Cloud services for that music. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This episode was recorded on <strong>Monday, June 6th</strong>.

Not to mention the active discussion we had with our fellow <a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/38/ask-different-chat\">Ask Different chatters</a>. We discuss the act of covering the keynote, or more specifically attempting to keep up with the coverage across at least 4 or 5 websites, and keeping up with all of the details flowing continuously for over 2 hours straight. We also delve into what we expect to see as all the new features begin to release, and where we would like to see as time goes on.</p></li>\n<li><p>On Tuesday, Steve Jobs presented the next major architectural work by Apple to the Cupertino City Council. We discuss the so-called  Apple Mothership  building to be worked on for the next 4 years and the consideration that is sorely lacking in too many other architectural endeavors.</p></li>\n<li><p>We know that as part of iOS 5, Apple will make Twitter functionality a first-class citizen with pop-overs including location sharing, single sign-on functionality, and a dedicated Twitter account field in Contacts. What we have recently learned is that additional social networks will become first class citizens and be added as contact fields in the Address Book.</p></li>\n<li><p>Yet another iOS 5 feature has received more details: Wireless iPad 2 Mirroring via AirPlay. We discuss the possibilities of utilizing an Apple TV in a conference room in order to simplify the process of presentations, and how to immediately greatly improve the quality of presentations, notes, and interactivity.</p></li>\n<li><p>Continuing with the WWDC hangover, we discuss the state of launcher applications, and the possibilities after Lion s release and official debut of Launchpad. We contrast the functionality offered by Apple, and the workflow exposed by launcher apps such as QuickSilver, Alfred, and LaunchBar.</p></li>\n<li><p>Our Question of the Week is <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/15624/upgrade-personal-iphone-to-ios-beta-5-0\">Upgrade personal iPhone to iOS beta 5.0?</a>, asked by <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/218/senseful\">Senseful</a> on June 9. We discuss if they (or you!) should, or should not, and lament that we are not more involved in the Apple Development Community in order to make the leap ourselves.</p></li>\n<li><p>Our App of the Week is <a href=\"http://www.acqualia.com/soulver/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soulver</a>. Soulver is a new kind of calculator. Soulver is quick, smart, clear, and flexible.

I had done some work, but it was a lack of people resources that kept me from getting too far, so I put everything down and went forward with more stable ventures.

Using FCP compared to iMovie is a completely different mindset, one where I actually felt overly-guided in iMovie.

It needs to be something the community collectively wants and will cultivate.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Define the scope and purpose of the blog. Is the blog about the site? Is it about the site s topic? Is it about the industry around the topic? Keep in mind the audience of your community and their interests. Another generic blog about  may not be all that interesting.  A community blog should be interesting to both current members and potential new members.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Recruit contributors. Who will write entries for the blog? Starting a blog is a bit like going through the buffet line. Be realistic   don t let your eyes be bigger than your stomach. Think seriously about if and how often you will be able to contribute a blog post, including research/prep time.  The more contributors there are, the less frequently each contributor needs to post.  One post a month is a much easier to stomach than a couple posts every week.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Plan a schedule. Given the results of steps #2 and #3, think about a rough idea of a schedule for the blog. Will there be one post a week, posted Mondays? Will there be  posts on Tuesdays and  posts on Fridays? You don t need to be pushing out posts daily, but you should post at least once a week.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n','4160','-1',NULL,'2017-03-20T10:29:37.673','2011-09-12T17:06:08.467',NULL,NULL,'Is anyone interested in starting, managing and/or writing for an Ask Different blog?','<discussion><blog>',5,0,1,NULL),(667,'2','666',NULL,'2011-08-08T00:02:03.757',5,NULL,'<p>Raise the idea on the child meta. \nDone, though it would be good to bring it up in the chat room too. </p>\n\n<p>Define the scope and purpose of the blog.\nI think anything related to Apple besides day to day news and rumors would be on topic.

Theres absolutely nothing wrong with that...

However, I think that weve maintained a pretty good balance here on Ask Different - we dont allow too many to be created, and the ones that are usually are informative and maintained. There are some that do fall through the cracks, sure, but I think that by and large theyre more beneficial than detrimental.</p>\n\n<p>One example of a benefit is with the recent <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/17759/what-tiny-thing-in-lion-makes-you-smile-or-has-caught-you-off-guard\">What tiny thing in Lion makes you smile or caught you off guard?</a> question, it was linked to on Reddit, Hacker News, and Twitter, and several other sites and brought a considerable amount of traffic to our site. This is very hard to do with a typical question because theyre usually of limited scope and of interest to a relatively small group of people. In order to get the network effect with a question, it needs to be one with a much broader appeal, and these tend to skew towards those that are of the Community Wiki style.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I think that the popularity of these questions may make it appear that there are more of them than there are, so here are some numbers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Total number of questions: <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions\">6,778</a></li>\n<li>Number of Community Wiki questions: <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=is%3Aquestion+wiki%3A1\">73</a> (1%)</li>\n<li>Number of Community Wiki questions with at least 1K views: <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=is%3Aquestion+wiki%3A1+views%3A1000&amp;submit=search\">12</a> (0.2%)</li>\n<li>Number of Community Wiki questions with at least 10 votes: <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/search?q=is%3Aquestion+wiki%3A1+votes%3A10&amp;submit=search\">17</a> (0.25%)</li>\n<li>Number of Community Wiki questions with at least 10 answers: 23 (0.3%)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So yes, I will concede that the questions, in general, dont really fit in with the rest of the site. But for the ones we do have we try to keep the quality high and the quantity low, and I think that eliminating them altogether would be a mistake.</p>\n','13','-1',NULL,'2017-04-13T12:45:27.673','2011-08-13T02:25:05.720',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,NULL,NULL),(700,'1',NULL,'701','2011-08-13T05:23:20.970',1,47,'<p>I flagged <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/21576/highlighting-color-nstableview-cocoa\">this question</a> as being off-topic, and later I noticed that the same question had been <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7038060/highlighting-color-nstableview-cocoa\">cross-posted to Stack Overflow</a>.

Normally, I would have deleted it, but since it received both answers and votes, I simply closed it.</p>\n\n<p>The second is because this is the type of community wiki question that acts as a black hole for what could more than likely be individual questions to be asked.

Chat messages can notify anyone who has been in the room <em>recently</em>.</li>\n<li>Comment notifications persist in your global SE inbox... Chat notifications produce a small indicator <em>within chat</em>, with an entry in the SE inbox only if you dont respond.</li>\n<li>You can only leave one comment every 15 seconds... You can post multiple chat messages within that timespan.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In short, chat messages will only notify people who are probably expecting them, having recently joined a chat room for the purpose of chatting.

Yet in my view, changing the IMEI seems fairly benign - akin to jailbreaking or unlocking (both of which we allow questions about), but I recognize that its possible to use that capability to avoid capture by using stolen phones in the commission of other crimes.

Laws are different all over the world, and legality changes. We discuss what is technically possible. For what its worth, asking how to use the Facebook app is likely illegal in countries where Facebook is banned. Asking how to send an encrypted message is illegal in some parts of the world. Asking how to read certain authors books in iBooks is illegal in some parts of the world. But certainly we dont want to ban these topics from the site, or at least not because they are illegal in some places. Asking how to read a particular author or work is a not terribly interesting question from a technical perspective.</p>\n\n<p>My understanding is that we dont discuss obtaining or using pirated software not because its illegal, but because that isnt the site this community wanted to be. There are other fora where such things are discussed, but that isnt what we are. If someone wanted to know which software was best for creating fake ID cards on a Mac, that wouldnt be a very technically interesting question, but I dont believe it would be off-topic.</p>\n','9388','9388',NULL,'2012-01-19T06:04:46.870','2012-01-19T06:04:46.870',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,NULL,NULL),(968,'2','966',NULL,'2012-01-03T23:51:00.853',4,NULL,'<p>To me, this big issue here is section 1(1)c and 1(1)d:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A person commits an offence if:<br>\n   - he offers or agrees to change, or interfere with the operation of, a    unique device identifier, or<br>\n   - he offers or agrees to arrange for another person to change, or    interfere with the operation of, a unique device identifier.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That means that if someone helps someone change the IMEI, or helps someone help someone change the IMEI, theyve violated the UK law.</p>\n\n<p>To me, this seems significant because a user in the UK could answer this question without knowing that hes in violation of the law.<br>\nIMO, we owe our users a little bit of protection from inadvertent things like that.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>It seems like, in the question you linked to, the problem is with the SIM card and unlocking the phone, and an IMEI change isnt necessarily necessary.</p>\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/15881/how-can-i-change-my-iphone-4s-imei-number\">other question</a>, it seems that the solution isnt to change the IMEI yourself but rather to resolve the standing issues between the user, Apple, and the carrier.</p>\n\n<p><em>As far as I can tell, there is no legitimate reason that a user would need to change the IMEI.</em><br>\nPlease correct me if Im wrong.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>So, here are my proposed solutions:</strong></p>\n\n<p>If a question has no legitimate value (i.e. theres no reason to do the illegal thing except for the exact reason that the law forbids it),<br>\n<em>and</em> its possible that someone could get in trouble just for answering the question...<br>\n<strong>Delete the question.</strong> Theres no reason to keep it, and its potentially dangerous.</p>\n\n<p>If a question has some legitimate value (i.e theres a good reason do do the illegal thing),<br>\n<em>and</em> its possible that someone could get in trouble just for answering the question...<br>\n<strong>Add a note to the question</strong> warning readers that its potentially illegal.</p>\n\n<p>If it isnt possible that someone could get in trouble just for answering the question...<br>\n<strong>Leave the question.</strong> At some point, as long as they arent endangering someone else, users can be responsible for themselves.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/18098/should-there-be-a-close-option-for-questions-regarding-to-some-illegal-activity\">Relevant MSO question</a>.</p>\n','2220','-1',NULL,'2017-04-13T12:45:27.043','2012-01-03T23:51:00.853',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,6,NULL,NULL),(969,'1',NULL,NULL,'2012-01-04T01:57:41.927',6,130,'<p><strong>January 28th, 2012 will mark  Ask Differents <em>1-year anniversary of graduation</em>!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Stack Exchange has offered to support a special Ask Different event in honor of that anniversary.</p>\n\n<p>Ive added an answer with my ideas, but exactly what we do is up to the community.

Yes, its Apple-related, but do the questions attract answerers with the same expertise? I think thats the biggest relevant question. If having these questions hosted here would improve the base of answerers for the questions that are currently on-topic, it could be a good idea.

In search results, \"How to\" implies you will receive instruction, but \"How do I\" can imply someone seeking help without necessarily implying that they got it.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: The exception to the rule is if you are providing an answer or other material that would cause a bump to the top anyway.  To be clear whilst the triviality is a concern, my actual problem with it is the unnecessary bump that is associated with it, so if its going to bump anyway, then edit away!</p>\n\n<p>2p</p>\n','9495','9495',NULL,'2012-02-02T18:49:18.877','2012-02-02T18:49:18.877',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,3,NULL,NULL),(1045,'2','1042',NULL,'2012-02-02T18:36:20.457',4,NULL,'<p>I think there are three parts to this question.</p>\n\n<p>The first is whether it is desirable for questions to say \"How do I\" rather than \"How to\". As a matter of style, I prefer a title lable rather than a complete sentence, but I do recognize that some estemed members of this site encourage complete sentence titles (even if they themselves occasionally use label phrases rather than complete sentences). I think a fuller label is preferable, but dont particularly want the title of the the question to be a complete, gramatically correct question.</p>\n\n<p>If we take as given that my preferences are ideosynchratic (or wrong) and that \"How do I\" is, in fact, better than \"How to\" in question titles, the next question is whether this is a sufficiently substantial edit to merit editing a post. I would again argue that the answer is no: if, in the course of making other substantive edits to a post, one also wants to trivially improve the title, go ahead, but it is certainly not sufficient to cross the \"substantial\" bar necessary to justify editing.</p>\n\n<p>Next, I believe, there is the question of whether a large string of such edits in a short period of time is ever in order. I would most emphatically assert that this is not good for the site. To have the home screen full of questions brought to the surface for a three character edit, thus drowning out the newly asked questions is the very definition of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_%28Monty_Python%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">spam</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I would say it would be my preference to take this one step further: not only should one <strong>not</strong> change \"how to\" to \"how do I\", but <strong><em>any</em></strong> edit that merely changes a clear title into a complete sentence question and does nothing else to clarify the title and contains no substantive edits to the content of the post falls into the category of \"too trivial\" to deserve an edit. Such edits, I believe, should be avoided.</p>\n','9388','9388',NULL,'2012-02-17T20:26:42.860','2012-02-17T20:26:42.860',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL),(1046,'2','1042',NULL,'2012-02-03T11:28:22.287',6,NULL,'<p>In my opinion, if an edit improves a question in some way, and someones willing to make it, they should feel free to make the change. Whether this is fixing a typo or retagging the question, the accumulation of all these tiny improvements will lead to a higher quality post, and a higher quality site.</p>\n\n<p>I also think that, the majority of the time, a questions title should also be a question, as it helps the person asking the question to identify the core focus of their problem, which in turn helps the people looking at the recent questions list get a better idea of what the questions in the list are asking. For people with the same problem in the future, the similar questions search in the \"Ask Question\" page is based off question titles, and the title is placed in the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> of the page, which is given additional weight in a Google search. Finally, having the majority of the posts on the site phrased in the form of a question serves to improve consistency, as well as to serve as an example to new users of how to ask their questions.</p>\n\n<p>That said, simply changing \"How to\" to \"How do I\" long after the question is asked and answered really only serves that last point as it didnt help the asker, the answerers, and provides no additional keywords for searchers. Still, I dont think that anyones arguing that changing the title is bad if theres other stuff that needs to be changed in the body and tags of the question as well, which indicates that an edit that changes the title from \"How to\" to \"How do I\", taken by itself, is at least not a negative.</p>\n\n<p>The point of contention comes with the fact that theres also a cost to each edit - every time a question or answer is edited its put back at the top of the active queue, the default sort order for the front page. If lots of edits are done in quick succession, they drowned out the actual open questions making it harder to get questions answered, and to find questions to be answered.</p>\n\n<p>The correct solution to this, in my opinion, is to build in support for non-bumping edits into the system. Wikipedia is a good example here - nobody gets chastised for fixing typos, and theres a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help%3aMinor_edit\" rel=\"nofollow\">way to mark edits as minor</a>, indicating that the edit does not change the content and does not need to reviewed.</p>\n\n<p>Barring that, however, I agree that edits to older posts should be done no more than a few at a time, and that its better to use those edits to fix up the posts that really need it rather than to change something minor. I disagree, however, that any edit that improves the post should not be made because its too minor. The quantity and frequency of the edits is the problem, not the fact that they change comparatively little.</p>\n','13',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-02-03T11:28:22.287',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,NULL,NULL),(1047,'2','1038',NULL,'2012-02-03T11:43:11.420',2,NULL,'<p>Before I seem like Im completely against this idea, let just start by saying that I have no problem with our site expanding its focus to include iTunes Connect.

Although subject matter expertise isnt a requirement to moderate, sometimes its necessary to have some basic knowledge in the subject in order to determine if somethings a duplicate, not a real question, etc. With the upcoming moderator election, its possible well be getting new moderators more capable of handling these topics, so we can definitely revisit this then.</p>\n','13',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-02-03T11:43:11.420',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,4,NULL,NULL),(1048,'1',NULL,'1108','2012-02-03T22:08:22.833',8,77,'<p>Our <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/badges?tab=tags\">list of tag badges</a> is pathetically small in my opinion, and in dire need of changes, the most obvious of which is iphone -> ios, yet I feel that any iOS answer (iPhone, iPod, iPod-touch and related, iPad) should count towards iOS.

Its not fair to produce a huge pile of work for the Mods when you are able to attempt to effect the change you think is required without the mod tools.

My participation is particularly low except for a few hot button topics that are not just confined to Ask Different.

Consider the existance of the following tags:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lion </li>\n<li>Lion-Server</li>\n<li>OSX</li>\n<li>OSX-server</li>\n<li>OSX-Lion</li>\n<li>OSX-10.7</li>\n<li>10.7</li>\n<li>10.7.2</li>\n<li>MACOS</li>\n<li>MACOSX</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I could ask a question that I could apply each of those tags to if I had a 10.7.2 Lion Server (and I do...), but lets face it most will just pick one, its (likely) not synonymed properly and as such we have several competing tags all creeping up to the badge tag required count which would likely all exceed it if consolidated.</p>\n\n<p>So, in summary, I dont necessarily agree with point 1, point 2 was answered elsewhere (they are automatic on count), and 3 would be good but wont be a panacea.</p>\n\n<p>While we are talking about improving the tag system, then in addition to your suggestions, I would suggest a way of selecting a tag from a list, and then be able to dynamically filter a list based on whether the chosen tag is a master <em>or</em> synonym as an aid to being able to select a group of tags and investigate their current synonym structure, which is almost impossible except as a manual endeavour at present (you can only type one filter).</p>\n','9495',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-02-15T15:01:35.037',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,NULL,NULL),(1108,'2','1048',NULL,'2012-02-15T15:48:56.600',2,NULL,'<p>From Meta: <a href=\"https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/67397/159930\">List of all badges with full descriptions</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <h2><a href=\"https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/68395/159930\">Tag badges</a></h2>\n  \n  <p>[ ] When a user meets the requirements for a tag badge that has never been awarded, the system creates and awards it automatically.

This means that the answers to the questions can change before the software is even released. Granted, answers to questions about released software do sometimes change over time, but not with the volatility of pre-release software.</p></li>\n<li><p>Pre-release software often has many <em>bugs</em> that will get fixed before its released. This means that questions about application behavior or finding workarounds will be obsolete by the time the software is released.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Its possible that there are questions about pre-release software that arent affected by any of these rules, but most are by at least one and its easier to have a blanket policy against such questions than to have to decide for each one.</p>\n\n<p>With regard to the questions about Mountain Lion, #1 definitely applies, as well as #3. #2 may not apply to announced features, but they could still conceivably change before its released this summer.

The downside there is some re-tagging will be needed and some user confusion will ensue. The benefit is one big tag to keep things together and make people with tag reputation goals and badges more likely to arise (by not segmenting the iPad questions). The other alternative is to leave iPad alone and general and to make up a tag for each model as needed. We can use synonyms to group things (say some use of iPad 2 (2nd generation) WiFi + 3G (Verizon) might be better pointing to iPad 2). This will also have some retagging when people dont tag correctly and some user confusion (but different users will be confused here).</p>\n\n<p>Regardless - it looks like well need a tag structure something like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPad</li>\n<li>iPad (1st generation)</li>\n<li>iPad 2 <strong><em>or</em></strong> iPad 2 (2nd generation)</li>\n<li>iPad (3rd generation)</li>\n</ul>\n','5472',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-03-18T18:21:38.543',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,3,NULL,NULL),(1195,'2','1167',NULL,'2012-03-20T10:39:54.860',-2,NULL,'<p>I advocate splitting product names and generations into seperate tag.  <code>iPad</code> <code>Gen3</code> is absolutely clear to me, and the only downside would be having <code>Gen3</code> applicable to multiple products but I dont see that as a large issue as no-one will ever search on a tag like that independently without providing scope via a product name.</p>\n\n<p>It depends on how you see Tags as fitting.

Less than a week into the contest, there are already as many people at level 2 as I expected would be there by the <em>end</em> of the competition.</p>\n\n<p>But along with a giant spike in readership, quastion-asking, and question-answering, I worry that were getting an increase in some less-desirable participation also. Lower quality questions, and attempts to game the system seem slightly less rare than they have been in the past. The addition of stakes higher than badges and reputation points (themselves a powerful motivator) has the potential to bring out an uglier side of our competitive natures. Here be dragons.</p>\n\n<p>While the promotion is bringing in wonderful new participants and dramatically increasing the activity of our current participants, what do we need to do as a community to help ensure that increased quantity doesnt degrade quality or community?</p>\n','9388','-1',NULL,'2017-03-16T15:45:18.873','2012-03-27T12:11:17.763',NULL,NULL,'How do we keep the exciting promotion from reducing the quality of the site?','<discussion><site-promotion>',6,0,3,NULL),(1198,'2','1197',NULL,'2012-03-21T10:06:28.177',5,NULL,'<p>I think the promotion is a good thing, and I am calling it a promotion rather than a competition because the competetive element is potentially a bad thing here.  However I have a few misgivings about the format:</p>\n\n<p>\"Realtime Updates\" - This is some really great code, but its intended purpose has a dark side, and knowing you are X shares away from getting Level 2 etc will just prompt some people to flood their communications channels with links because they know they are close.  Check chat for the reduced number of onebox links and the increase in the personalised links.  Ive done this myself, and am not proud.  The fact you can check on the other guys too means you can get too involved trying to beat the others, rather than put out genuine content that would be welcome even without a promotion.  If the idea is to promote being a good citizen, then the winning citizen by definition would have done it anyway, and shouldnt be doing it merely because theres a prize.  Removing the update would potentially stop borderline genuine users from caning the site for 3 weeks then leaving because they wont have a clue if they are caning it in vain or not, whereas a \"better\" user will carry on regardless.</p>\n\n<p>\"New Users\" - Obviously you had a brief when setting this competition up, and you will know what your expected outcomes are and what you wanted to achieve.  No way to know <em>exactly</em> what these things were, but what we seem to have is an influx of people (some new, some previously dormant) throwing up a <em>lot</em> of content.  The \"acheivements\" for want of a better word for getting X answers voted on etc reward quantity without necessarily have any controls of the quality.  If I ruled the world (in my lovely hat) I would like to see the promotion be more tailored to getting people to use the site properly, rather than to use it lots; this should foster the same end result inadvertently anyway.  I know this is difficult, but helpful flags and other badges may be a good way of getting the existing audience to use the site better, which should in turn equate to <em>more</em> at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>\"Tactical voting\" - Im not saying this has happened, but I am saying when the time comes close to the end, it likely <em>will</em> happen.  Someone with the required 4x6 upvotes will find one gets mysteriously downvoted to 5 votes and rules them out of Level 3.  Im raising this now so you are prepared for it, I know votes are supposed to be invisible, but you will for sure get a query I feel.  Thats not me saying I will do it of course, but its human nature when a big prize is at stake.  And theres the other side too, people not voting for someone who is close to moving up a level in the competition etc as a way to maintain a gap in the scoring.</p>\n\n<p>\"Shares\" - Ive tried to share and point out exactly why I am doing it.  Each time I have put shares out on Twitter I have book ended it with non share tweets about AD and the promotion.  I dont want to link bait my friends, but I do want to turn some of them into users here.  As I mentioned previously, Im sure a lot of the shares are actually being shared in chat where discussion is pretty busy at the moment.  These shares defeat the intended purpose, as they never leave the site, and are only ever seen by existing users.  Perhaps a better mechanism is to allow a referal scheme  in a future competition.  Having a challenge to introduce 2 new users who get say 250 Rep and 5 selected badges within a month of joining would actually be a way to ensure higher quality inrease in visits that results in tangible benefits.</p>\n\n<p>As I have other thoughts, I may edit them in here.  Overall I am 70% positive on the promotion.  I hope it acheives its aims, and of course I hope I win an iPad, and further still if I do, I hope I <em>deserved</em> to win on the basis of maintaining very active but more importantly very focussed input to the sites real aims which still stand apart as worthwhile content.  Ill still be here after, as I was here before.  This is not an \"old guard\" (Ive only been here what 7 months?) piece of disgruntlement against new users though, I hope that the conversion or \"sticky\" ratio of the more recently active users is increased post promotion.  I would hate to see someone with enough free time simple hammer the site for 3 weeks and then hit the sunset with iPad in hand.</p>\n','9495','9495',NULL,'2012-03-21T11:12:58.110','2012-03-21T11:12:58.110',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,NULL,NULL),(1199,'2','1197',NULL,'2012-03-21T12:13:05.540',4,NULL,'<p>Thank you for posting this.

Anything that increases activity carries some risk that the site will see an increase in lower-quality content. Because of that, we always try to run promotions past the moderators to get feedback, and we only run large promotions like this on sites that have a community strong enough to moderate a large influx of content.</p>\n\n<p>In this case, we designed the promotion a little differently than past promotions because we thought it would be more interesting, less competitive, and have better results. Our past promotions were mostly tag contests, where wed pick a tag and a timeframe and give prizes to the top or most viewed posts. The drawback with that kind of promotion is there can only be 1 or 2 winners, so it causes more competition. Although there are limits to the number of people that can win iPads and iPods in this contest, its pretty high. That doesnt mean it eliminates all competition, but it does mean that you can cheer people on and vote for their posts without dramatically decreasing your own chances of winning. Because of that, our hope was that people would still be willing to vote other posts up or down when appropriate, as per usual, without concern for whether it would affect their own status in the contest.</p>\n\n<p>The real-time updates were meant to make the promotion more interesting to watch and increase the likelihood that people would participate. It just makes it easier to keep track of things that you can mostly find anyway. Since it s easy to see where you are, we figured it would make people more likely to come back and try to reach that next level. I see stuffe s point that it might cause people to flood their communication channels - we tried to reduce this by allowing you to share posts anywhere you want instead of just your own Facebook and Twitter.</p>\n\n<p>This is not a perfect promotion, so I appreciate the discussion and feedback. To some extent, there s no way to avoid a little bit of competition when prizes are involved. My hope is that most people are on the site because they love Apple and find the Q&amp;A helpful and interesting. The bar for winning this contest is set pretty high, which I think keeps out most people who are just here to win an iPad. Those people will always be around, but were doing our best to reduce the damage they might do.</p>\n','13125',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-03-21T19:45:05.627',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,4,NULL,NULL),(1201,'2','1197',NULL,'2012-03-21T20:27:19.933',9,NULL,'<p>I want to expand on my comment to <a href=\"https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1200/\">Lauren</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Some of my remarks in the chat room of late might be interpreted to mean that Im against the this contest. This is not true. I am very appreciative of the efforts that Lauren (and whomever else is deserving) put into creating and promoting the contest. I am thankful to Stack Exchange for committing the resources necessary to provide <em>killer</em> prizes like iPads and iPod Touchs. I am hopeful that the exposure that the contest brings will bring new growth and excitement to Ask Different.</p>\n\n<p>I am especially hopeful that a few members of our community who have put forth extraordinary efforts, particularly in the area of providing high quality answers, will be rewarded for their efforts. I know it wasnt the lure of an iPad that motivated them to begin with, but that doesnt mean they cant be rewarded after the fact.

There is a lot of <em>good</em> in this contest and it has brought a lot of life to Ask Different.</p>\n\n<p>What I am <em>against</em> is the effect that the contest is having on our community.  New faces are popping up and posting without taking the time to learn what <strong>Ask Different</strong> is all about. Previously dormant users are rising up and posting multiple questions for which answers are a simple <em>RTFM</em> (or Google search) away. Even some of our long time members are posting questions about which I harbor doubts. Is it a <em>real</em> question? Will an answer actually <em>make a difference?</em> Does the OP really <em>care</em> or is this just to <em>put some points on the scoreboard?</em> The quality that we fight hard to maintain is being eroded and there is something distasteful about the <em>edge</em> that competition brings to our site.</p>\n\n<p>I know that we have the tools do deal with all of these challenges but at times I feel like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Fury\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nick Fury</a> battling <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HYDRA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HYDRA</a>; <em>Cut off an arm and another grows to take its place.</em></p>\n\n<p>The bottom line is that hanging out on Ask Different has been less pleasant of late.

Once the edit has been made, the comment is redundant and can be deleted.</p>\n\n<h2>Long Discussion</h2>\n\n<p>Long comment threads are discouraged. The system automatically steps in and offers to create a chat room if things get too bad, but sometimes long discussions do pop up.</p>\n\n<p>If it appears that the discussions are done, have served their purpose, and are no longer adding to the post, they can be deleted or thinned/abbreviated.</p>\n\n<h2>Rude/Offensive</h2>\n\n<p>I have yet to see a rude or offensive comment that adds any value to a post. Most rude comments are on answers that someone doesnt like: <em>\"What a stupid way to do this! Ive been using a Mac for a week and even I know better than this!\"</em>. These comments are mean, and could be better expressed with a downvote.</p>\n\n<p>Thats not to say, of course, that a friendly, constructive comment explaining how a post could be improved or why it was downvoted should be deleted.

Referring to an <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code> URL for an online copy of the page may present a manual that is <em>too new</em> or <em>too old</em> for the users system. Linking to an <code>x-man-page://</code> URL will ensure that the page, read in OS X, is proper for the system.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ease of use</strong>. The settings used by Terminal in response to these URLs are more immediately user-friendly than, say, entering <code>man grep</code> at the command line. Windows such as those below <strong>respond normally</strong> to the close box, to Command-W, down, up, page down and up keys, scrolling and so on: </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5fNOE.png\" alt=\"a screenshot of Terminal using its Man Page settings for intro (1)\"></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/e86cC.png\" alt=\"a shot of Terminal using its Man Page settings for mdfind (1)\"></p>\n\n<h2>Assumptions</h2>\n\n<p>It will be possible to enable this feature discretely, in <em>apple.stackexchange.com</em> areas alone</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>other stacks might be less welcoming of link protocols that are operating system-specific.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The reader will use OS X when following a link that is intended to open Terminal.app</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>for this reason, I chose Ask Different for this meta question.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Questions of a type that might include <code>x-man-page://</code> URLs are not likely to be migrated to any stack other than Ask Different. </p>\n\n<h2>Risks</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Without OS X</strong>, a reader may be confused by links that their system can not handle. Minimise this risk by use of plain english. With the shortening workaround suggested by Kyle, any one of the following examples might be plain enough: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://is.gd/mddiagnose\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">view the manual page for mddiagnose in OS X</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://is.gd/mddiagnose\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">view the manual page for mddiagnose in Terminal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://is.gd/mddiagnose\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">view the manual page for mddiagnose in Terminal.app</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://is.gd/mddiagnose\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">view the manual page for mddiagnose in Terminal in OS X</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1249/8546\"><strong>Verbosity and gobbledy-gook</strong></a>. This exists in some man pages, not all. If a person will be daunted by the content of a page, then he or she might prefer to read that content in a web browser (solutions such as Bwana are given in answers elsewhere). </p>\n\n<p>However: most such content relates to use of Terminal, so I argue that theres value in encouraging <strong>uses that can make Terminal less daunting</strong>.

We should be trying to do the best we can achieve, not simply better than next guy.  The benchmark should be where your personal pride and motivation takes you, and not be judged against the next users aims.</p>\n\n<p>I think that the original intent was to get people to promote the use of Ask Different to an expanded audience and increase general participation levels, and initially this happened very well, but towards the end of the competition this resulted in the voting percentages dropping hugely (anecdotaly, at least for the Level 3 users) as users realised that complying with the spirit of the competition might have an affect on their chances of winning the iPads.  This has a knock on affect that latter Q&amp;As were top heavy on answers, often similar answers, and low on votes which <em>could</em> produce the outlook to the new users we were trying to attract that no-one was providing genuinely good answers, which is obviously contrary to the aims of the site in general, never mind the competition.  You can look at pretty much anyones rep curve for the 3 week period and see this marked \"Hump\" affect as the patterns altered during the period.</p>\n\n<p>In order to prevent this, I have 2 recommendations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Provide a greater element of <em>Randomness</em> when selecting winners.  There were 10 Level 3 users, and if the rules had been something like \"The Top Score wins an iPad for being amazing, everyone else is in a raffle to win the remaining 4\" it would have produced odds of 4 in 9 to win an iPad - this is still really really great odds that would inspire people to work hard, and means that there is no difference to coming 2nd or 10th, so long as you worked hard enough to get into that level in the first place.  \"Tactical\" voting would be greatly reduced, as it would not really be possible to affect the result by doing it.</p></li>\n<li><p>Either cut down on the ability to follow other users scores, or go the whole hog and provide the <em>whole</em> story in the contest progress pages.  Looking at the lists (and knowing that there was a <em>big</em> difference between 5th and 6th) made it very tempting to compare your results against other users and use that as a basis for choosing who to selectively fail to vote for.  During the last few hours of the contest it turned out that at least 4 people in the top 10 had written scripts to query the APIs and rank the current contestant scores.  Whilst the data is public, better to either stop it happening (possibly by not <em>explicitely</em> starting the exact tie-break mechanism from the start) or level the playing field and prepare them for everyone up front.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Lastly, a big thanks to everyone at SE that helped to organise the thing - We know that @Lauren and @balpha were heavily involved, but I am sure that there are more names behind the doors that also deserve thanks.</p>\n','9495','8318',NULL,'2012-04-05T18:03:06.833','2012-04-05T18:03:06.833',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,4,NULL,NULL),(1262,'2','1260',NULL,'2012-04-05T13:27:16.277',2,NULL,'<h2>Share links on @StackApple Twitter</h2>\n\n<p>IMHO, the @StackApple Twitter account shouldn t tweet or retweet a contest entrant s personalised share links while the contest is still running.

This only turns the other way if users restrict themselves from voting. (When does this happen?) Therefore, changing the rules must ultimately take away the contestants ability to have that much influence on who wins the prize. A <em>randomization</em> of winners is a good way out of this dilemma.</p>\n\n<p>Consequences: In order for the randomization of winners to work, there needs to be a set of potential winners that is large enough, otherwise the direct competition between contestants remains.\nFuture contests need to have thresholds for levels that are easy enough to reach. If reaching a level is so difficult such that only about as many contestants reach a level as there are prizes for that level, users will still compete against each other and may try to avoid pushing each other up.</p>\n\n<h2>Quality matters</h2>\n\n<p>Do \"low thresholds\" encourage low quality posts?\nThe requirement to achieve thirty-five posts with a score of two did two things: It promoted voting in the beginning of the contest because voting on posts did not directly decrease your own chances of winning - there were simply <em>so many</em> required. However, it also discouraged contestants from putting more effort into their answers for the same reason.</p>\n\n<p>If the minimum requirement to reach a level would require posts with more that two votes, users are pushed to provide answers with greater content. But, at the same time contestants should not be required to achieve too many of such posts because then the threshold to reach a level would be to high and contestants begin to compete against each other.</p>\n\n<h1>Summary</h1>\n\n<p>If you agree with my arguments, you will see that one needs to (partly) <em>randomize the selection of winners</em> and <em>find the right balance</em> between...</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>...the minimum requirements to reach a level and</li>\n<li>...the maximum requirements to reach a level</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If the requirements are low, the randomization of winners works well, voting is generally promoted but more low quality posts emerge as well.</p>\n\n<p>If the requirements are too high, the randomization of winners does not work, voting drops and contestants become rivals.</p>\n','13414','13414',NULL,'2012-04-06T14:03:17.260','2012-04-06T14:03:17.260',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL),(1266,'2','1260',NULL,'2012-04-07T16:27:41.863',5,NULL,'<p>My answer extends on  that of <a href=\"https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1265/9388\">@gentmatt</a>, which in turn extends on the answers from <a href=\"https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1261/9388\">@stuffe</a> and <a href=\"https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1263/9388\">@NathanGreenstein</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Im impressed with this community, and how we didnt let crazy incentives destroy our sense of community. The promotion wasnt designed as a competition, and it didnt get competitive until people blew the thresholds out of the water to a degree unanticipated in the design of the promotion. I think we did a good job staying non-evil, but, of course, incentives do matter, so perhaps we can tweak them in any future promotions</p>\n\n<h2>How could we have done this had we known then what we know now?</h2>\n\n<p>In hindsight, I think it turns out that the winning bars should have been higher in terms of quality (more posts with at least 6 or even more votes), perhaps lower in terms of quantity (encouraging a <em>lot</em> of two vote questions/answers maybe isnt a great thing for the site), and shorter in terms of the length of time the promotion runs.</p>\n\n<p>If the winning bar for this one were so high that <a href=\"https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/users/13414/gentmatt\">only one crazy person</a> were likely to be able to make it there, I suspect it wouldnt have been a competition; it would have been a lot of people cheering him on. But then the promotion wouldnt have drawn in as many people.</p>\n\n<p>I think the idea of some fixed prizes and some randomized is a good thing, but Id like to see a different mix, with a smoother gradient between the deterministic portion (you <strong>will</strong> win this prize) and the purely stochastic (<strong>anyone</strong> who meets the minimum threshold has an equal chance). No abrupt cutoffs mean no cutthroat competition to be the one right above, and not below, the cutoff, but improved odds for better performance encourages everyone to do their best.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps something like</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the high scorer in the promotion wins an iPad.</li>\n<li>for people who complete <em>x</em> shares and vote at least <em>y</em> times, each question or answer with 8 (10?) or more votes gives you ten tickets in a drawing for one of 5 iPads.</li>\n<li>for people who complete <em>w</em> shares and vote at least <em>z</em> times, each question or answer with 4 (5?) or more votes gives you ten tickets in a drawing for one of 25 iPod Touch devices.</li>\n<li>No one can win more than one prize.</li>\n<li>If fewer than 5/25 people meet some minimum threshold, fewer prizes are given out.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Even better if the random drawing algorithm could be sophisticated enough that if you cast upvote #1-8 for a question or answer that ends up reaching 8 votes, it slightly improves your chances of winning yourself (things that would give you ten tickets give you 11 tickets, for instance) -- wouldnt it be great if we could reward constructive edits and constructive voting, given that theyre what makes the site work?</p>\n\n<p>Then, theres still an incentive to vote for quality. Theres an incentive to post <strong>good</strong> stuff, and not just anything. And theres a link between merit and success, but some element of chance also.</p>\n\n<p>Its not just luck, but it isnt cutthroat competition, either. Helping along your fellow participants is rewarded, but theres a direct link between posting great things and improving your own chance of winning.</p>\n','9388','-1',NULL,'2017-03-16T15:45:18.873','2012-04-07T16:27:41.863',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL),(1267,'2','1260',NULL,'2012-04-09T16:04:30.890',3,NULL,'<p>Good:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Goals were achievable</li>\n<li>Prizes were guaranteed for the top 30 contestants</li>\n<li>Prizes were substantial (Im not going to put in hours of effort for a tshirt, but Ill put in a lot of time for an iPod and the possibility of an iPad)</li>\n<li>I really dont like contests where the odds are determined by the number of entrants, but this had a good balance of difficulty and large number of prizes that it was reasonable.  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Improvements:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It sometimes took more than a day to get various clarifications regarding the contest</li>\n<li>Clarifications that were made occurred on a number of posts, and it appears that those who hung out in chat had somewhat of a better grasp on the contest than those relying solely on the contest rules and meta posts.  I dont know that any clarifications were made in chat, but perhaps some were.</li>\n<li>While I applaud simple rules, and while I understand no one believed the tie-breaker would be needed, it was obvious that some were confused as to how exactly the tie-breaker would be computed (specifically which posts counted) and that this confusion persisted until nearly the end of the contest.  I had stopped contributing posts because I thought that the first 35 posts that reached 2+ were locked in - so this misunderstanding resulted in me contributing less in order to improve my final contest score, until I finally understood it was the top 35 posts during the contest. Such misunderstandings, if not corrected early in the contest, can work against the point of the contest.</li>\n<li>As an outsider coming in primarily to compete in the contest, I was surprised at how easy it was to compete, and how the contest was not biased towards regular contributors.  It doesnt need to overtly balance towards regular contributors, and part of the contest is to bring in new regular users, but perhaps the rules can be set up so that those who \"live\" here find it easier to compete.</li>\n<li>The mix between random and guaranteed awards was imbalanced.  15% of the prizes went to the drawing, and 85% to the higher levels.  For those who knew they could get into the higher levels without difficulty its not an issue, but if I was at all unsure, then I wouldnt have participated even to reach the lowest level.  I think it would have been better to have something like 1 ipad and 5 ipods for the level one drawing.</li>\n<li>I generally agree with the others that each level should be drawn - otherwise you should simply do away with the levels altogether.  Once you have a \"bucket\" where you are either present or not, sub-ranking within the bucket is more complex and leaves the system open to more gaming.</li>\n<li>If you dont want to do a drawing inside each bucket, then consider downplaying the buckets, and using \"contest points\" instead.  Each 2+ post gives you 1 point per upvote, each share gives you 1 point for every 5 people who click on it, each day you spend all 35 votes you get another point, etc.  Then everyone can see where they are in the rankings on a daily basis, and know exactly what they need to do in order to be in the top 5 for the ipad, or top 30 for the ipod.  You can still have a minimum participation requirement that needs to be fulfilled before youre eligible for each level - the bucket is still there - its just not emphasized.

Id like to get a StackExchange sponsorship to cover airfare and hotel stay if possible.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong><em>Who</strong> is going?</em></p>\n\n<p>Im going.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong><em>What</strong> conference is it, and what will you be doing there, besides attending?</em></p>\n\n<p>WWDC is Apples annual developer conference. Typically, Apple announces updates to iOS and Mac OS and occasionally some other cool things. Ill be just attending, unless you consider being awesome \"doing something\", cuz Ill be doing that to. If the community approves, Ill also be promoting AskDifferent.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong><em>When</strong>  is the conference running? We need at least a month s lead time to help you get your approval. If you re under or near that before posting, you might want to think about next year instead.</em></p>\n\n<p>The conference runs in just about a month from now, from June 11th through the 15th, 2012. It might be a bit late, but I only found out about the scholarship on Friday.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong><em>Where</strong>  is the conference located and how do you intend to get there?</em></p>\n\n<p>The conference is Moscone West in San Francisco, California. Im in New York City so I plan to fly out. My iPhone doesnt have teleportation built in - yet. </p>\n\n<p>\"Siri, take me to Moscone West at -\" </p>\n\n<p>\"I know where Moscone West is, thank you. Please adjust your helmet and tell me when youre ready to go.\"</p></li>\n<li><p><strong><em>Why</strong> should the community approve you to go to this sponsorship? More importantly, why should the community approve going to this specific conference? Basically, what will you do to bring this learning back to the community?</em></p>\n\n<p>Im a long time member of the StackExchange network. Ive been active on StackOverflow for over two years. Ive got 11 gold badges including fanatic. I was among those awarded the first batch of AskDifferent Swag. I also won an iPod in the recent new iPad contest. So, yea, I participate.</p>\n\n<p>Ive met with Lauren and Seth at StackExchange HQ in the New York and brought back swag to my class in college, and promoted English.SE there. (Thanks guys, that was awesome.) Im constantly pushing StackExchange to friends, classmates, coworkers and more. This would be another opportunity to do that. </p>\n\n<p>WWDC is chock full of Apple and thats the exact audience of this site. It would be an opportunity to bring more experts users to one of the best Apple websites on the internet. I love speaking and meeting people. StackExchange is something that I can get excited about, and I will do my best, if approved, to promote AskDifferent at WWDC.</p>\n\n<p>Again, my ticket is already paid for by Apple. A StackExchange sponsorship would cover airfare (around $500 or so) and hotel stay. (Although Im looking into another option which would eliminate the hotel costs altogether.) </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>edit:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ive been developing <a href=\"http://apps.mosheberman.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">apps</a> for over 2 years now.

Would you perhaps add an answer here explaining some more of what you were trying to do and how a name change would help? Its clearly a suggestion that goes against the grain, but lets bang it around and see if the plusses could outweigh the negatives. Id love to hear criticism of the new user process in the event we can shape things or make it easier to get new users to ask great questions or benefit the most from the content here - no matter how we get there.

The educational value is potentially significant, not limited. The scope is narrow, but I dont think that is a valid reason to close, and the appeal may be limited, but maybe not.

Furthermore, the two down-votes were given <em>after</em> it was closed, and were therefore very likely influenced by the fact that the question was closed. Im not sure the question would have been down-voted if it had remained open.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the official (not comment) reason for the closing does not apply. I fail to see how this question would solicit <code>debate, arguments, polling, or extended discussion</code>. To the contrary, this site and a community-wiki question seems like the ideal place for such a repository of facts.

I think that since the \"group\" tag is very generic and can be used in a multitude of situations, maybe it should be removed and more specific group-related tags created \"Unix-group\", \"chat-group\"/\"group-conversation\", etc. This would remove the ambiguity surrounding some questions with that tag.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe theres a specific reason for allowing tags to be ambiguous that Im not aware of, but to me it seems like we should either:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Remove generic tags</strong> and create <strong>more specific</strong> tags that are related (\"group\" -> \"unix-group\" + \"chat-group\").</li>\n<li><strong>Tag more accurately</strong>. For example, if Im asking how to group windows, maybe I dont need to use a tag specifically dictating how I want to manage my windows; maybe I could just use a tag thats a little more general but not too broad like \"window-management\". </li>\n<li><strong>Write specific descriptions for new tags</strong>. This way, if Im thinking about using the \"group\" tag, I can read the description and see if it applies to my question.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Again, if theres a specific reason for this tag ambiguity, Id like to know, but otherwise, I believe that one of my three proposals should be put into place.

The tag suggestions pop-up helps, only if the tag itself previously exists, has a description, and the user chooses to read it.</p>\n\n<p>If you mean a technical policy wherein the user is brought to a tag-edit dialog immediately after their post their question, that is worse. Things like that drive users away from a site. And they can always close the window or click another link to bypass the screen.</p>\n\n<p>I dont believe a policy of forcing users that create a tag to explicitly define it will help, primarily because when a user is focused on something like the content of their question, theyd likely describe the tag specific to their situation.

This is a question that could have a correct answer, but it is well-suited to a correct answer that is a single large list, not a bunch of answers, each of which provides one program that breaks under case-sensitive filesystems. So I believe the first part could be salvaged as its own question. The downside to this is that such a list <em>could</em> become inaccurate quickly, depending on how updates to the software change the filesystem requirements. So if we wanted the list question, whoever answered it would need to curate it. This could work, but the site doesnt handle it ideally</p>\n\n<p>The second part asks for workarounds to make these programs work. This is actually a series of very good questions, each of which would be quite on-topic and welcome here on its own. If one work-around could work for all (or many) of the programs, the second part of the question could be a single question.

The issue is that our system is ideally designed to produce a single \"best\" answer that the OP can accept as correct.

(Example: This pointed me to several very useful pieces of software, including helping make me aware about the existence of both Homebrew and MacPorts (previously I had only heard of MacPorts).)

I love the command line, so the concept is great, but the answers are not so great.  Most of the answers are lists of command-line programs (without explanation of why those are important or what they do).  That probably isnt super-helpful: if you know what the command-line program does, you already know whether you want/need it or not.  This <em>could</em> have been useful if it gave an overview to command-line programs that readers probably <em>werent</em> already aware, and an explanation of what those programs do and why you need them ... but thats not this question. </p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/5435/24154\">Got any tips or tricks for Terminal in Mac OS X?</a> - I would not recommend closing a question that <em>so</em> many people have apparently found useful (going by the number of upvotes and favorites).  And some of the answers are useful and good stuff.  I found this to be a helpful resource, so I dont think the question should be closed.  (I see that it has been \"locked\".  I tend to think it should be unlocked.  I dont see any reason why it should remain locked or how it adds value to prevent others from updating their answer or adding new answers.  Im not used to seeing \"locked\" questions and am not clear on how \"locked\" differs from \"closed\".)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These are just my personal opinions.

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>\n\n<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>\n\n<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>interesting apple related open source apps</li>\n<li>the sites twitter account</li>\n<li>script packs or power tools</li>\n<li>cool events or conferences</li>\n<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own communitys interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>\n\n<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>\n\n<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>\n\n<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>\n\n<h3>How does it work?</h3>\n\n<p>The answers you post to this question <em>must</em> conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>All answers should be in the exact form of:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]\n\n   [1]: http://image-url\n   [2]: http://clickthrough-url \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Please <strong>do not add anything else to the body of the post</strong>.

On AD I think that the hand of the moderator is perhaps subtly softer than on many sites.</p>\n\n<p><strong><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c8c6cf98893e485d3f0424830efcf8ca?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG\" alt=\"stuffe\"> <a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/20840/stuffe\">stuffe</a> <a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/8103785#8103785\">continued</a>:</strong>  We have a greater mix of new and low rep users, and a smaller mix of higher rep users who would even notice the diamond full stop.

There are never enough people doing it, and it usually comes down to a few good folks slogging away.

Since we want to optimize for questions that allow for (or perhaps even demand) good answers - everyone should be more <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/90704/5472\">interested in fixing the question</a> if thats the real problem. Rather than delete an answer that points out the question needs help, lets use the tools to fix a question or guide someone that is attempting to move the discussion forward and only delete an answer if it truly is not of better quality than the question itself.</p>\n\n<p>As moderators, we try to keep some order in terms of deleting things that are actually offensive, mean spirited or blatant spam <em>(spam - n. advertising that is either repetitive or totally not relating to the question)</em> . And we are also here to ensure that criticism of specific choices or functions is constructive as opposed to be unsubstantiated accusations or blowing off steam at someone elses expense, so be sure to use the correct flag if thats your primary complaint with a specific post.</p>\n\n<p>Heres a great post that should be flagged as not an answer.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MFfyN.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>The only way that would be an answer is if someone asked an off-topic question and we would want a flag on the question since I cant really blame the answerer for a mis-placed question.</p>\n\n<p>Here is what a moderator sees when declining a flag when \"not an answer\" is in play:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yq85f.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>So, as you can see, <strong>even if an answer is totally wrong</strong>, thats <em>not enough for us to delete it in almost all cases</em>. It has to be unsaveable by an edit and we like to see that the bad answer has a down vote or two and hopefully a constructive comment before we like to step in and summarily delete an answer. Even totally wrong answers with a polite, concrete rebuttal is of great use to the community. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Think how many people with a similar wrong answer in their mind</strong> could be helped if we kept all the wrong answers online, searchable, but properly down-voted and explained as to how and why the post is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>Since our site has so few trusted users, the reopen queue is not maintained well, and when a moderator deletes something, its extremely rare that anyone will see it, let alone have a chance to fix it.</p>\n\n<p>The next time you flag something as \"not an answer\" - do a check to see if it can instead be voted / commented if the poster has clearly tried to move the discussion forward. Not all answers are right from the get-go, but we need to give new users and the collaborative editing process a chance for some answers rather than just deleting them outright. If a post shows any effort to help others learn, it should not be flagged or deleted.</p>\n\n<p>If youre reading to this point, realize that when you dont comment and dont vote and dont edit before you flag a post as not an answer, you havent shown any care and just tossed your perceived problem to the moderator team to handle. Moderating is what we signed up to do as volunteers, but the reality is that when 30 flags for NAA lack any effort at community moderation, your flag however well intentioned, can become a problem. </p>\n\n<p>Wed like to avoid patterns of flagging things as NAA without performing any moderation of the posts in question. Try to not load the flag queue with things that you can start to resolve if the community has given you enough reputation to start moderating these posts via vote, comment and edit privileges.</p>\n','5472','-1',NULL,'2017-04-13T12:45:27.673','2016-08-24T11:09:18.257',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,9,NULL,NULL),(1631,'2','1628',NULL,'2013-02-28T01:42:11.850',1,NULL,'<p>Status aside, I dont doubt that you saw this, but I dont see it, and I doubt you see it anymore either.

If ANYONE confused this boards ownership as Apples that would be trademark infringement.</p>\n\n<p>Last, a new name.  Okay, \"Ask Newton?\"  Oh wait, that doesnt make it clear that this is an Apple board and not a physics board.  \"Ask Granny Smith?\"  Then you just have to know that Granny Smith is a stand in for Apple, instead of it being an exchange about the Fresh Prince of Bel Air.  Kind of like you have to know that Ask Different is a play on Think Different.  Look, you are attacking a lot of peoples interest with a VERY bad idea.

If you read the <strong>and it is not about </strong> this question is very much not a fit for Programmers. Its not a professional programmer asking a question and it is about what language to learn next and what book to read (or what training course to take).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/faq\">Ask Different</a> is for Apple enthusiasts and power users. And the question isnt really about using Apples iTunes Connect service (or other services) and more about looking for advice on how to become a programmer.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/faq\">Stack Overflow</a> is for professional and enthusiast programmers, people who write code because they love it. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So Stack Overflow seems the perfect place for this sort of question. Its targeted at someone about to embark on being a programmer so the subject matter fits there best. Now, that question wouldnt fly in Stack Overflow for a multitude of other reasons, the first being this part of their FAQ \"what not to ask here\"</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Your questions should be reasonably scoped. If you can imagine an entire book that answers your question, you re asking too much.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This question as phrased seems to be a great example of asking too much. The OP needs to find a mentor to guide them so that they can learn enough to ask pointed, researched, clear questions about practical, solvable questions that will be of use to the programmer community. The question of what to do next is very individual and primarily opinion-based so all Stack Exchange sites will generally close questions that do not have work done to make their subjectiveness minimized.</p>\n\n<p>Now that Ive shared why I feel this general topic is a poor fit here or on Programmers, lets address the next point.</p>\n\n<p>This again is a great example of a question thats too broad that any expert cannot arrive on the site and know what the asker is really asking. Specifically:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is it really about learning Objective C or about learning Cocoa or an appeal for which frameworks work well for iOS and OS X programming?</li>\n<li>Is it looking for a university program to embark on a career?</li>\n<li>Is it a hobbyist with spare time looking to punt around and make a widget or two?</li>\n<li>Is it a C# coder looking for a book to apply those idioms on a new language?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If the asker put more effort into that question, it might be a great question according to the criteria that community moderation is designed to enforce. However, keep in mind even a bad question can be saved with a great answer so if enough people vote to re-open it, it could survive to get a good answer.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, its off-topic here since its not really about iTunes Connect which is the only part of being a developer we explicitly list in our FAQ. This might be the first effort to change the FAQ - but Id want to see three or four great example questions and answers discussed here before Id support adding \"learn to program\" to our list of topics. </p>\n','5472','-1',NULL,'2017-05-23T12:40:12.040','2013-04-29T14:02:08.530',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL),(1673,'1',NULL,'1674','2013-05-02T09:24:03.000',5,75,'<p>I tried posting a comment <strong>@Greg Cain: Great!!!!!</strong> which is about 22 character long, while trying posting it says </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Comments must be at least 15 characters in length.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See the picture:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/z2LnC.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Please indicate me if i am doing any thing wrong.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Its not accepting \"@Greg Cain: Greater!!!!!\" even, which include 15 alphabets.</p>\n','48483','49393',NULL,'2013-07-25T22:33:15.483','2013-07-25T22:33:15.483',NULL,NULL,'Cant post comment even if its 15 character long','<discussion><bug><status-bydesign><comments>',1,0,NULL,NULL),(1674,'2','1673',NULL,'2013-05-02T09:35:13.703',11,NULL,'<p>Its not considering the @-reference as part of the comment.

Yes, there is clear mention in the setup that a developer happens to be the user, but in the specifics no code (Objective C, Xcode compiling or API) are actually involved in the topic. It is pure terminal commands that are accessible to each and every Mac that ships. You dont need to be a developer to answer the question, you dont need to install Xcode, you dont need anything except for knowing that terminal exists and that Apples OS exposes hardware details to shell scripters and that the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nm_%28Unix%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">GNU tool</a> <code>nm</code> lets you map the details of a file.  </p>\n\n<p>So, if we are to allow questions about \"homebrew\", \"gcc\", and other open source tools that rely only on the terminal - it seems odd to throw out this question that uses open source tools to look at Apples hardware. Similarly, you can use command line tools to check GateKeeper status, code signing status, whether the network connection is wireless, ethernet or something else and I see this question as fundamentally about how someone can know what hardware is installed by using OS X to get at hardware details.</p>\n\n<p>I happened to know all this, so I was able to flag this question for re-opening, but I wanted a meta thread to explain the difference between closing something that <strong>we knew as asked</strong> was off-topic versus something that <em>might get edited or answered</em> in an off-topic manner.</p>\n\n<p>Despite all that, this question doesnt have enough details to make it \"system-admin friendly\" in that the specific problem isnt with loading or unloading a <code>kext</code> but with finding an API thats declared in the kernel (totally fine for this site) and looking for the development portal to access that undocumented internal API. (totally not fine for here)</p>\n\n<p>Ill close this again which is what the first moderator did unless it gets edited to be more on-topic for admins as opposed to developers.</p>\n','5472','5472',NULL,'2013-06-22T23:06:24.180','2013-06-22T23:06:24.180',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL),(1743,'2','1722',NULL,'2013-06-25T09:31:48.623',6,NULL,'<p>Another aspect to consider is whether accepting hackintosh questions helps improve the quality of Ask Different.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the questions Ive seen so far fall into the category <em>\"I own XYZ.

Create a sandbox instance of Ask Different, and remove/revert-to-plain the customized JS, CSS, and other parts, one at a time, until the issue goes away, identifying the errant part.

So if you follow that approach to flag stuff as spam (especially for answers around the usual suspects like video conversion and data recovery of any kind) youll probably have a rather high approval rate.

The headphone socket does not work on OS X, use Ubuntu</em>\".  I could have used a couple of reasons for deletion such as \"Not Constructive\", or I could have added a formal post notice to it.  In my haste, I didnt explain it fully (for which I take one on the chin without prejudice) but believe me I feel confident that it would have been flagged by another user if I hadnt happened to see it first so soon after you posted it.</p>\n\n<p>I think you will agree that in the form against which I moderated it, it was not really an acceptable answer, and more of a rant, unless you were genuinely of the opinion that telling the OP that it just doesnt work by design and to use a stop using OS X on an Apple Q&amp;A site was being helpful.</p>\n\n<p>While your edit is much less combative its still saying more or less the same thing, and using some language that isnt necessarily required which adds a negative tone to the content; \"<strong><em>If I dare</strong> plug in the headphones</em>\", why not simply state \"<strong><em>When</strong> I plug in...</em>\"?</p>\n\n<p>Even with further modification, I think there are still issues with the answer, namely:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Your own contribution is still \"<em>Doesnt work; Use Ubuntu</em>\", and the external links are simply links with no summary or overview</p></li>\n<li><p>Your summary is incorrect, its a hardware problem, and nothing to do with the OS.  Just because Ubuntu doesnt support the extra functions and defaults to normal headphone mode doesnt mean OS X is at fault.  Even the links you provide state for example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><blockquote>\n  <p>\"Inside the jack is a very small switch that turns on and off the optical audio output while simultaneously disabling the internal speakers. The switch can be turned on by simply using headphones.\"</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><blockquote>\n  <p>It seems that when removing the headphones with a yank after editing some audio, I must have accidentally flicked a switch inside the port. The MacBook Pro thought that there was still a TOSLINK connector attached even though there wasn t anything plugged into the port.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This sort of thing is common in a variety of devices that use headphone sockets.  Here is pretty much the same issue on someones iPhone (Not directly caused by a <em>toslink</em> switch, but caused by a gummed up socket that has the same end result - the socket thinks something is using it): <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/81879/apple-headphone-remote-doesnt-always-work/81889#81889\">Apple headphone remote doesn&#39;t always work</a> (I would suggest trying the accepted answer and seeing if it helps if you still have an OS X install on the machine).</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps explain why I removed it.

People are not reviewing the OS, or product, they are showing their delight at particular bits which they really appreciate, and helping to crowdsource the Ask Different review, in a way.</li>\n<li>The voting aspect means that rather than being a duplication of stuff you can read elsewhere, its a case of the community ranking those features by most useful.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, for me I think that they should stay, nominally in the same format that they do now, however with the following provisos</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>They should not be created by anyone - there is a bit of a painful rush to be the one who creates the one for iOS8 etc, and as a result the first attempt at creating one is often done poorly.</li>\n<li>They should be created by a Mod, using a predefined template, preferably several days earlier than required and then temporarily put on hold until they become appropriate to open properly.  This should help in two ways, firstly they get worded correctly, secondly any user trying to duplicate it by creating their own <em>should</em> see it as a duplicate before posting</li>\n<li>We should stop trying to force these square pegs into round holes by attempting to word the question in a way that tries to justify it as a genuine Q&amp;A style problem.  Requesting <em>undocumented</em>, or worse <em>under-documented</em> features is just a horrible hack to try to make it a real question.  We know the purpose of these CWs is to <em>talk about cool stuff!</em>.  Every time someone starts commenting on the answers showing links to where an answer is already documented online, or arguing about what constitutes <em>documented</em>, and it just turns some of the comments into little sniping matches that saps the fun.  Lets just be honest about the purpose of the questions.</li>\n<li>The answers need to be policed more carefully.  No more one line answers with a screenshot that dont add to the equation, lets get people being effusive about why they contributed this answer.  Some of this would be down to the question wording to ensure people arent just racing to tick off the features lists.</li>\n<li>The whole thing should be protected for a day or so after opening so only repped users can set the ball rolling with quality answers that serve as an example of how to answer.</li>\n<li>They should be appropriately tagged with a tag that shows that it is more of a participation piece, than a question - Not sure what we would use, other sites have the idea of \"canonical\" answers etc.</li>\n<li>Our site guidelines should be updated to reflect the above as CW policy, to show that for appropriately created CWs they are on topic</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The above should go a long way to making them more enjoyable for everyone.  Not having a clear policy (whichever one is agreed) always invites some random Mod or high rep users from other sites to come and poke fun at our site.  These questions are unique in style to Ask Different, they dont appear on any other SE site, and while they are clearly not a genuine Q&amp;A format, sure that is <em>exactly</em> why we have the concept of the Community Wiki - for what other purpose does it exist if not for the couple of times a year when we might want to do the above.  Other sites have their own idiosyncrasies that are not a perfect SE fit, whether its \"Name that book\" or recommendation based questions.  This is Ask <em>Different</em>, not Ask <em>Like a all the other SE sites using this prescriptive format for every single contribution</em>.</p>\n\n<p>There remains however, one problem that I do not know how to resolve.

Im currently in need of a battery replacement in my MacBook Pro, but other repairs may come up as I try to extend the life of my Apple investment.</p>\n  \n  <p>How can I be certain that any replacement parts I order for my repairs that are obviously Apple genuine parts, are at least Apple compatible parts?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That seems to capture the spirit of your question, not wanting to order the wrong thing when going DIY in a country where returning an order can be problematic and expensive, but without asking for specific purchase advice that would quickly become obsolete.</p>\n\n<p>Does that help?</p>\n','292',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2013-11-29T20:36:31.623',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,6,NULL,NULL),(1882,'1',NULL,NULL,'2013-12-06T11:44:57.857',8,791,'<p>Its the time of the year again, namely it is December 2013, and so we shall now refresh our Community Promotion Ads for the new year.</p>\n\n<h3>What are Community Promotion Ads?</h3>\n\n<p>Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>\n\n<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>\n\n<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>interesting apple related open source apps</li>\n<li>the sites twitter account</li>\n<li>script packs or power tools</li>\n<li>cool events or conferences</li>\n<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own communitys interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>\n\n<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>\n\n<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>\n\n<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>\n\n<h3>How does it work?</h3>\n\n<p>The answers you post to this question <em>must</em> conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>All answers should be in the exact form of:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]\n\n   [1]: http://image-url\n   [2]: http://clickthrough-url \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Please <strong>do not add anything else to the body of the post</strong>.

Now were at the stage where that happens without a moderator needing to act. As the high rep user base grows, the deletion will also follow to be something that can happen without needing a flag or a moderator to cast a binding vote.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at forest and not the trees - delete content that is so bad that you feel no normal user should even have to see it.</p>\n\n<p>Posts that should be deletes are where the only content is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>offensive (racist, homophobic, juvenile, curse)</li>\n<li>in no way on topic (astrology adverts, soccer match, handbag sales, etc...)</li>\n<li>completely redundant and inferior to an existing answer/post</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you can remove the problem parts of a post by editing, that is the way to go and not deletion.

As such it was flagged by another user of the site (actually it was flagged twice by different users) which brings it onto our review queue.  @bmike was merely the first person with the authority to handle the flag who saw it, and he removed it as per our posting guidelines, because answers that are commentary/discussion/me too/thanks/another question etc are not valid ones, and he indicated as such in a comment to explain why he removed it.  I just need to make sure you understand that an Admin didnt \"just come along and remove it\" for no reason, it went through our proper flag and review process, and I would have reached the same conclusion and removed it also.</p>\n\n<p>Now, as for why you had to do it this way because of your low reputation score, thats another story.  I have to disagree with you when you say \"It doesnt make sense and works against the boards intentions\".  To my mind, it makes perfect sense, and thats only partly because I get to see <em>everything</em> that is posted, including all the stuff we have to remove regularly to keep the site on topics and used as it is meant to be used.  It takes <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges\">very little effort</a> to earn enough rep to be able to vote and comment, and you should really try to gain these privileges in order to then progress your own questions properly.  The privileges are earned in a way that allows you to contribute properly and to guide your contributions to ensure they are appropriate by not allowing your to, for example, engage in lengthy discussions in comments (Not saying you would have, but it happens, and when such stuff is then subsequently flagged, I can almost guarantee its a low rep user who hasnt quite got it etc).  Making you earn your privileges avoids a <em>lot</em> of clean up required by the Moderators.</p>\n\n<p>Now, finally as to the existing answer, and why it wasnt removed you just need to consider that when a contribution is flagged, there is no requirement for whichever of us <em>volunteer</em> Mods to then go and perform a full audit of the Question and all its Answers that havent been flagged.  Its there still because no-one has flagged it, because its got votes, and because while its not a solution to the OP, it is still a <em>valid answer</em> to my mind.  If you don;t think it is, you only need 15 rep to flag it to us in the same way your post was flagged, and well review it.  Please consider that this isnt a personal tech helpdesk service where we have to answer your question the way you want it in a \"customer is always right\" sort of scenario.  Everything on the site, from the moment it leaves your keyboard, is community owned and community edited and moderated.  While the answer might not be what the OP and yourself are looking for, if we feel it may well help <em>other people</em> in the future, we can leave it there.  The community will up and down vote and flag as appropriate to ensure that answers are <em>useful overall</em>, and very often a *\"You cant do that\" is appropriate.  In this particular scenario, while I imagine that a couple of people may have the skills to identify and solder individual components onto a motherboard without damaging it, I imagine there are also a lot more people who would appreciate being told that this is the only way and the replacement at a part level is maybe a better solution for those of us without mad skills with the flux.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I hope this explains the general reasoning behind why what was removed was removed, and why what is still there is still there.  Please just take the time to look around for a couple of questions to answer.

Ill try to answer your questions.</p>\n\n<p>OK, you have a little misunderstanding about the nature of Stack Exchange sites.  Stack Overflow was the first and original site, and then Stack Exchange was setup to create further sites along different topics.  These days there are SE sites for everything from coding to parenting via philosophy and bicycling.  You can see a <a href=\"http://stackexchange.com/sites\">full list here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We dont have <em>groups</em>, as such, but each sub-site (usually called sitename.stackexchange.com e.g. apple.stackexchange.com but sometimes with their own redirecting URL such as askdifferent.com for our site etc) is essentially a wholly seperate entity, with their own topics and their own rules for what is on-topic etc.  Clearly asking about nappies on a Ubuntu site is not appropriate! ;)</p>\n\n<p>What can link them, is you - your user account can be linked to many such sites, you have a profile on each site, and nominate one (usually your first) to be your <em>parent profile</em> under which all others are linked.</p>\n\n<p>When you do this, if your reputation score on one SE site is sufficient, you can a 100 <em>association bonus</em>, the purpose of this is to remove the early privilege limitations whereby you need to earn reputation in order to do more than the basics - as the message says when you are awarded the bonus, you are trusted to know how to use an SE site, and dont need to prove that again.  The reputation is added to the profile in the site you just joined, purely to remove the new user restrictions - you cant add it to your rep from another site.  Overall, it is calculated in your total rep across all sites, but you cannot, for example, join 50 sites and get a 5000 bonus on your primary profile...</p>\n\n<p>Now, as for Objective-C programming, the main coding site is still Stack Overflow.

I think we have covered it a few times before, but I dont feel like hunting for duplicates, I think engaging users in fresh conversation on such topics in Meta is more important than pointing them to what has been said before.  Not like this place is high enough traffic to worry about the odd duplicate.</p>\n\n<p>I wont answer your 3 questions directly (well; yes, everyone, not many) but rather discuss a few things about this site which might well result in a few insights why I genuinely think that Ask Different <em>really is different</em> from most of the other SE sites.</p>\n\n<p>Lets go to other sites first.  Here, for example are a list of a few other other sites I use; Bicycles, Arqade, Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy.  I use those sites differently to how I use this one (even before I was a Mod too) - those sites are centred about topics for which the majority of users share not just a common interest, but a common passion.  For many of the other more IT related sites (Ubuntu, Super-User) those people too are there not just because they have a problem, but because they have a passion for their subjects, or in the least for the technical IT sites are at least <em>skilled and knowledgeable</em> enough to be able to participate.</p>\n\n<p>Now, with Ask Different, things are different.  We dont have such a well defined audience of people (either passionate or highly skilled).  A lot of our users are here not out of a passion for Apple, but out of frustration due to not being able to do <em>something</em> as a normal everyday person.  And that <em>something</em> is such a wide remit.  We are here to discuss \"Apple\", the company and anything its name can be loosely associated with.  And these days, that covers so much stuff:</p>\n\n<p>Hardware:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Desktops</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Servers</p></li>\n<li><p>All-in-ones</p></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Laptops</p></li>\n<li><p>Monitors</p></li>\n<li><p>Tablets</p></li>\n<li><p>Phones</p></li>\n<li><p>iPods (from nano to Classic via Touch)</p></li>\n<li><p>Headphones</p></li>\n<li><p>Peripherals, Mice, Keyboards etc</p></li>\n<li><p>Routers</p></li>\n<li><p>Backup Systems (Time Capsules)</p></li>\n<li><p>Accessories, from covers to cases to docks etc</p></li>\n<li><p>Apple TVs</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>And these are just the first party hardware topics</strong>  Imagine if I bothered to create a list of the software topics, everything from Apple Script to ZFS...</p>\n\n<p>This is the key, our focus is so <em>overly broad</em> that while we can and do have a core membership of highly skilled, experienced, and generally perceptive users, our core membership consists of people that bought something in a shop and cant get it to do what they want.  And basically, most Apple stuff these days is by and large a commodity product.</p>\n\n<p>Its the difference between having a site revolving about engine tuning and performance upgrading etc, and one for \"Ford\".  We are guaranteed to get the dumber questions, the ill-informed users, the poorly thought out content.  Its just the nature of the massively wide audience we have.  Other sites take the cream off the top of their particular areas of interest, and gather them together to form a community.  We simply take in randoms off the street, people who arent here to stay here, but people who want to get in, get help, and get out.</p>\n\n<p>Now is this a problem?  Yes in many ways, I doo feel our participation levels and community feel seems <em>lesser</em> than many of the other sites we use</p>\n\n<p>Whos burden is it?  Well, its everyones, but being practical its really (and unfairly) on the Mods, the High Level users, the Long Term users to try to corral everything into something like quality content, and we simply dont have enough of those as a percentage of all users like other sites do.</p>\n\n<p>What can we do?  Keep calm, and carry on.</p>\n\n<p>As an aside, the first link you direct us to about the Terminal problem, I think is actually a good question.  Its a genuine problem, well described with enough info to ensure it gets a proper answer.  And I suspect that is where some of the frustration behind your question comes from (good frustration, expressed properly, not having a go here).  You and I probably know where to look or how to have a quick Google to fix that in seconds.  Youre obviously a skilled and experience IT guy.  But the OP?  Chances are hes a guy who bought an iMac after loving his iPhone, has played about in Terminal so see what it is and such, maybe fiddled with settings, and now has gotten stuck.  Hes just a guy off the street with an IT problem.  Hes not an IT guy on an IT site participating in an IT community.</p>\n\n<p>Its a tough one, and hits at the heart of the biggest problem with this site.  I dont see a fix.</p>\n','9495',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2014-06-19T11:40:54.257',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL),(2161,'2','2159',NULL,'2014-06-19T16:21:13.740',2,NULL,'<p>Im going to answer with something that Ive found to work well for me on the site.</p>\n\n<p>When I get a vague question, I pass it through three filters:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Is this problem common enough to be useful to 10 or perhaps 100-1000 people in the coming years?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If the answer is yes, I then ask myself:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Did this person provide enough information for someone to actually answer it?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>All the questions that arent going to be useful <em>(in my opinion of course)</em> I usually comment with a hint and/or a short sentence to point the way to how to troubleshoot and/or to the [help] which describes how to ask a good question.</p>\n\n<p>Its important to me to not spend more time answering / commenting than the effort the asker put into the question. It makes no sense to over-answer until I start the conversation with the OP - often they are highly motivated and edit the question into an awesome one and we gain a great user to the site. Other times, its a drive by question and the OP never even logs in again to the site.</p>\n\n<p>The second category - questions with enough detail to answer.</p>\n\n<p>I usually take a stab at answering unless the site will benefit most from a guide how to troubleshoot that issue. For example - when MobileMe was duplicating peoples contacts and calendar entries - I would probably launch in to a pretty detailed troubleshooting process - linking to Apple KB rather than just answer the OPs narrow question.</p>\n\n<p>Since thousands of people are going to need help and not all of them might be as precise as the OP - I might actually answer for others and not the OP directly. I would also typically provide the OP with the precise answer they need in the comments to my answer.</p>\n\n<p>The one last piece of advice is that I would challenge anyone to decide early with each question. Choose to either answer it directly or answer it with a troubleshooting procedure. Mixing the both tends to get messy and confusing to others - especially people that come later with the same problem. Having two answers on a question - one with a definitive answer that ABC fixed this problem for the OP and a general - heres how to see if your problem is the same and troubleshoot it is of the most benefit for the site as well as for the answerer and asker. <em>(IMHO)</em></p>\n','5472',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2014-06-19T16:21:13.740',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL),(2162,'1',NULL,NULL,'2014-06-22T03:54:52.460',1,36,'<p>There is a little yet annoying bug in the site.</p>\n\n<p>I am writing a (big) answer.</p>\n\n<p>In the text area, I have the view at the top.

Straight to the point, succinct title</h1>\n\n<p>Dont use words like best or good - just tell us what you want. Were not going to recommend the worst, or bad software. For example, a great title could be<br>\n  <strong><em>What [editor/utility/program/plugin] does [task] in [manner]?</em></strong></p>\n\n<h1>2. Describe your task</h1>\n\n<p>This is mandatory - Tell us in clear words what youre doing, or intend to do with what we recommend. If youre bulk re-sizing a bunch of pictures while converting them to another format, or looking for a game to waste time in chunks of 15 minutes - let us know with as several specific and relevant details.</p>\n\n<h1>3. Describe what you have, if anything, and what you dont like about it</h1>\n\n<p>This can sometimes be optional, but let us know what youve got or what youve tried and didnt like, and why. Let us know if you looked at something and decided it wasnt for you. Note - this allows for great answers that may recommend something you dismissed by explaining a feature you overlooked.</p>\n\n<h1>4. Give us an enumerated list of constraints, in order of importance</h1>\n\n<p>Every recommendation question probably needs this list. Tell us the features or operating constraints a good fit would meet, ordered from must-have to nice-to-have. An example:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Must run on MacBook Pro (Mid 2013) with 10.8 (and not 10.9)</li>\n<li>Must be available outside the Mac App Store</li>\n<li>Ideally takes less than 20MB of initial download</li>\n<li>Big plus if it does not offer / need in-app-purchase</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Note: Price is generally a bad requirement. Limiting the question to free or less than $x does two very bad things. First, it doesnt help others as everyones budgets change based on how important the task is to them. Secondly, prices change (and your budget changes over time) and the cost at basecamp on mount everest doesnt match the price for London or Chicago. Thirdly, once we have collected good software that does X - everyone can easily price them out and select an answer thats best for them when they go to buy.</p>\n\n<h1>5. Wrap up your question, if it needs wrapping up.</h1>\n\n<p>You can probably skip this most of the time if you want, but this is a place to put anything supplemental. </p>\n\n<p>Your goal when writing is to narrow the scope enough so that realistically, 10 answers might directly answer it.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Thats everything someone needs in order to give you a great recommendation. We may not be able to meet all of your requirements, but since youve listed them in the order of importance, well be able to recommend something that gets the most important job done. By thinking about asking a great question, you will be helping many other people as well as the potential pool of people that will step up to make an answer to your question.</p>\n','5472','-1',NULL,'2017-03-16T15:52:39.157','2016-08-27T18:30:16.963',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL),(2182,'1',NULL,NULL,'2014-07-25T03:13:58.200',0,228,'<p>I know this question has already been asked, but with the public beta release everyone can access and get Yosemite.

The Watch is committed to be released in Early 2015 (assuming that regulatory approval is granted). Apple Pay was committed in October 2014 and I dont have a good date for when Home Kit will arrive.</p>\n\n<p>The reasons for prohibiting questions in general about pre-release software is to maintain the possibility to have <em>high quality</em> answers that dont enter into rumor, reading tea leaves, or over-parsing limited details that are released before the work to finish the product is done. Had we allowed Health Kit answers, we would have had incorrect information at launch as well as demonstrably poor answers to health kit questions until 8.0.2 and releases today September 29 allowed consumers to actually use the product.</p>\n\n<p>The Stack Exchange sites are optimized to provide <strong>great answers</strong> by attracting knowledgable, expert people to address clearly worded questions. We even tolerate miserable questions when there is a demonstrated good answer or the possibility of a good answer to be provided.</p>\n\n<p>With pre-release products that may or may not be covered with NDA - the pool of professional, capable, and knowledgable answers is severely limited. Furthermore, anyone that comes up with a good answer can probably be assumed to be breaking NDA. That environment fosters a \"those who know arent talking, those who are talking dont know\" effect.</p>\n\n<p>By widening the prohibition, it helps site moderators of all reputation levels to know that they should probably close most or all questions on pre-release software so that the site doesnt waste attention and discussion on un-answerable questions.</p>\n\n<p>Once the product is released, all of the on-hold questions are easily reviewed and edited and reopened for all of the well worded questions.</p>\n\n<p>I have seen these patterns as a user of the site as well as one of the elected moderators since day one. By following the same spirit of discouraging all but the most answerable and helpful questions on pre-release software - we would have consistency by prohibiting all but the most answerable questions about pre-release hardware and services.</p>\n\n<p>My vote is to edit the [help] to broaden the prohibition on pre-release to cover hardware and services.</p>\n','5472',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2014-09-30T02:47:37.480',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL),(2222,'1',NULL,NULL,'2014-10-01T18:15:40.260',3,40,'<p>Sometimes I see posts (questions and answers) written in HTML, with &lt;i> and &lt;b> tags for formatting, &lt;a href=  tags for links and one or more &lt;br>s for paragraphing.</p>\n\n<p>Should I edit these posts to use Markdown formatting?

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>\n\n<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>\n\n<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>interesting apple related open source apps</li>\n<li>the sites twitter account</li>\n<li>script packs or power tools</li>\n<li>cool events or conferences</li>\n<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own communitys interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>\n\n<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>\n\n<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>\n\n<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>\n\n<h3>How does it work?</h3>\n\n<p>The answers you post to this question <em>must</em> conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>All answers should be in the exact form of:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]\n\n   [1]: http://image-url\n   [2]: http://clickthrough-url \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Please <strong>do not add anything else to the body of the post</strong>.

It\n  seems that iTunes   or, more correctly, the usbmuxd process that\n  handles connections between a Mac and and iOS device   has some\n  problems. This process opens network connections to the iOS device in\n  order to communicate with it. It opens two connections, one using IPv4\n  and another with IPv6, over TCP, to port 62078. If you run a command\n  in Terminal, you can see how many connections are open.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wonderful! Someone made some progress! But still, it s only really of concern for those who use Wi-Fi sync and not  tethered  sync. And the problem is not solved.</p>\n\n<p>So personally, I believe my original question and answer thread which barely exists should be deleted. But how should a new question be written/framed? Should it simply be: <i>iOS and iTunes Syncing Issues Since iOS7 and OS X Sync Services Removed</i> or something else?</p>\n\n<p>This is massively frustrating to me since I cannot help but feel that with 10,000+ views there are others struggling with this issue. But with no clear hope in site and nobody else really chiming in on the thread what can be done?</p>\n\n<p>The question feels like a freak show.

Common reasons for edits include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>To fix grammar and spelling mistakes</li>\n<li>To clarify the meaning of the post (without changing that meaning)</li>\n<li>To include additional information only found in comments, so all of the information relevant to the post is contained in one place</li>\n<li>To correct minor mistakes or add updates as the post ages</li>\n<li>To add related resources or hyperlinks</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Clearly, substantial is a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWdd6_ZxX8c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">matter of opinion</a> in many cases. Basically, When I reviewed the post after you asked on meta, I saw Georges edits as failing to meet any of these criteria. I understand many feel that using \"code blocks\" is a \"mistake\" however, when you point that out to the OP and they say they intentionally formatted it that way - were not into opinion and judgement.</p>\n\n<p>If you wish to make a second answer with the formatting of your choice, that might be the best avenue if you really feel the post <strong>needs</strong> correcting and if you comment and the OP declines your help with the edit. In that case, the moderation will arrange a chat room for the editor and the OP to discuss things in hopes of coming to a mutual agreement. Only if that fails would a moderator step in and perhaps lock the post in one state.</p>\n\n<p>Were not there - were just at the \"one edit was made and then rolled back\" stage.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for all the comments and down votes - its nice knowing that people really care about the small things. I ask that everyone keep \"the big picture\" in mind - the site exists to allow great answers. Why antagonize one poster with minutia like changing their emphasis style when nothing else is wrong with their answer and a ton of things are right with the answer.</p>\n','5472','-1',NULL,'2017-04-13T12:45:27.043','2015-02-24T17:13:57.913',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,11,NULL,NULL),(2363,'1',NULL,NULL,'2015-02-18T13:22:29.610',-2,31,'<p>Jawa you can edit, can you help solve my problem please?</p>\n','115166',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-02-18T13:28:41.757',NULL,NULL,'Jaws help solve problems instead of just editing','<discussion>',1,0,NULL,'Shasta'),(2364,'2','2363',NULL,'2015-02-18T13:28:41.757',3,NULL,'<p>Welcome to Stack Exchange and Ask Different.</p>\n\n<p>We are community edited and community supported, so some people will edit questions that need help or that they think need help.</p>\n\n<p>Your best bet is to edit your question after reading the [about] and [help] sections for the main site.

(Or someone can see how to edit this into a neutral question)</p>\n\n<p>The issue that I would raise is how can we keep this up to date. This question was asked in Sept 2010. The comments and answers imply that the base model with 4GB RAM would be sufficient. However nowadays I would suggest that Xcode takes more memory and you need 8GB. </p>\n\n<p>I also think this is not objective as development covers a lot of things. Simple web front end development in HTML and CSS needs no more than add ins to a browser whilst writing large C/C++/Objective C/Java programs require much CPU and memory for compilation.</p>\n\n<p>What possibly could be done as occurs in the uprooted answers is to emphasis which parts of a Mac are worth upgrading e.g. RAM to a certain level, then SSD rather than Hard disk and then also CPU e.g. <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/178325/is-it-better-to-have-more-cores-or-higher-processor-clock-speed-to-decrease-buil/178350#178350\">this</a></p>\n','237','-1',NULL,'2017-04-13T12:45:26.843','2015-03-31T18:58:40.473',NULL,NULL,'Canonical question on hardware specs','<discussion><canonical-questions>',1,0,NULL,NULL),(2421,'2','2420',NULL,'2015-03-28T17:55:08.683',1,NULL,'<p>I think there are two edges to this sword:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The minimum requirements are really that. Absolute minimum - I really like steering one question on the site to be just that. Apple authors first party tools to create iOS apps and they are Xcode. If your Mac runs Xcode - it can develop apps. Full stop.</p></li>\n<li><p>Opinions on what makes a reasonable minimum setup will vary. In fact, it has to vary. A student in a country that has no Apple stores, perhaps limited access to the internet very rightly could want to know what is needed to program an iOS app. They might rightly not care about the latest and greatest and would need an answer taking their requirements into factor. Similarly, someone with three Macs and a budget might very rightly consider hardware that meets the minimum requirements not a solution even worth entertaining. Their answer would rightly not care about budget and really be asking about workflow and efficiency.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>For the good of the site - I want to find and identify the question that best handles case 1. It would link to Apples Xcode page and perhaps the minimum requirements page to run OS X. It would then be a resource to teach people the baseline and/or a place to hilight alternative answers covering non-first party tools.</p>\n\n<p>At that point, we have a solid baseline and a link to meta with \"the one\" or \"the few\" canonical questions. From there, we can then entertain and/or close questions of the nature of \"I need storyboards and home kit to develop iOS apps and debug them\" vs \"Im a student and I need a project to spend 40 hours over the next three months - will my Uncles hand-me-down iMac running 10.6.8 and Xcode 3 be enough to program my jailbroken iPod stuck at iOS 5.1.2\"</p>\n\n<p>If this all makes sense - the work will be for 10k users to identify and help isolate or edit questions to serve as #1 and not get stuck changing a type #2 question. That will a) irritate the OP b) be more of a mess in general since opinions have to vary based on budget and goals. If we cant find a good #1 question, then you or I will need to ask it and leave all the existing questions to serve role #2.</p>\n','5472','22824',NULL,'2015-03-31T18:58:40.473','2015-03-31T18:58:40.473',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL),(2422,'1',NULL,'2423','2015-03-29T05:37:26.103',0,30,'<p>Once upon a time, I thought I could approve edits.</p>\n\n<p>Now I get this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This suggestion still needs 1 approve vote from other reviewers.

From <a href=\"https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/19756/how-do-comments-work\">How do comments work?</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Comments exist so that users can talk about questions and answers\n  without posting new answers that do not actually answer their parent\n  questions. Comments are often used to ask for clarification on,\n  suggest corrections to and provide meta-information about posts.</p>\n  \n  <p>Comments are intentionally short, having maximum length of 600\n  characters, and allow only limited markup. URLs in comments\n  automatically become hyperlinks. Each user may post only one comment\n  every 15 seconds.</p>\n  \n  <p>Comments are disposable: unlike posts, theres no revision history,\n  and they can be deleted without warning by their authors, by\n  moderators, and in response to flags.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As for why your comments are disappearing, if they werent deleted by you, they have been flagged by other users or a moderator. Again, from that meta post:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Comments that are flagged by multiple users are deleted automatically.\n  The number of flags needed is based on the comments score. It\n  currently takes \"3 + (Score / 3)\" flags to delete a comment.</p>\n  \n  <p>Moderators can delete any comment, or purge all comments from a post.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Specifically, from that meta post, I draw your attention to:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You should not expect them to be around forever: Once a clarification\n  has been made, an edit added to the post to include new information,\n  or the issue in the comment is otherwise resolved, it is subject to\n  deletion. In reality, many obsolete or chatty comments remain\n  untouched due to the high volume of comments posted, but this does not\n  mean that they cant or shouldnt be deleted in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would characterize your commenting behaviour on the site as being \"overly chatty\" and thus you see a high number of your comments removed.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, you shouldnt be making comments as a permanent record of anything on Stack Exchange sites. They are to be \"used to ask for clarification on, suggest corrections to and provide meta-information about posts\" -- not for providing witty remarks, \"thank you\" type posts or for long-drawn out back-and-forth discussions on questions and answers.</p>\n','292','-1',NULL,'2017-03-20T10:29:37.673','2015-04-03T20:33:24.877',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,NULL,NULL),(2431,'2','2429',NULL,'2015-04-03T20:28:28.930',4,NULL,'<p>I delete a lot of comments.

The \"NDA situation\" is complicated (and there are 4 different versions of the NDA that Ive seen or believe to exist). We will lose some people and we wont get all the questions we might if there were no NDA, but there still are formal NDAs covering the beta software that Apple is providing. We should acknowledge that clearly since some questions will inevitably breach someones NDA.</li>\n<li>The history of Ask Different comes from the Trilogy (<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com\">SO</a>/<a href=\"https://superuser.com\">SU</a>/<a href=\"https://serverfault.com\">SF</a>) and inherited specific close reasons designed for those sites and those times - <a href=\"https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4818/what-questions-should-be-closed-with-reason-too-localized\">closing questions solely because they are too narrow</a> is <a href=\"https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/184154/closing-changes-on-hold-unclear-too-broad-opinion-based-off-topic-reasons\">no longer appropriate here (or there)</a></li>\n<li>Apple is certainly changing quite rapidly in therms of enrolling thousands and millions of people in their beta programs - this mitigates the main complaint I see against beta questions which is not having enough expertise to get useful or constructive answers. Yes, some people are signing NDA - but all of those NDA are time limited and covering less and less of the product as Apple publicly hours and hours of detailed video as well as <a href=\"https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/6876#16139\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">publicly opened their extensive developer discussions</a> to the public at large.</li>\n<li>Apple forums dont exist for all beta users (just for invited seed participants and paid developers), and we dont close shop on Q/A just because <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/welcome\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Apple Discussions</a> also exists for user questions and answers. </li>\n<li>Apple Developer forums are now publicly readable just like the WWDC videos and developer documentation, so in effect, anything posted on these sites is \"published\" directly by Apple and that could weaken NDA claims on content hosted there in the open.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Specifically, Ask Differents active users have had two years of experience with letting extremely narrow, unlikely to be widely applicable questions be asked and I feel the site is better for them. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now for <em>my opinions about the above facts</em> in relation to how I see the site growing and adapting to Apple and to the users of this sites needs today and going forward.</p>\n\n<p>I dont see any harm if people ask a question like <strong>In beta build 15A204h of 10.11 I cant log into FaceTime and dont know which error log to look</strong> or <strong>Is there a way to figure out why this specific app wont run under gatekeeper on beta build 15A204h?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I would like to be able to keep questions like the following open as Apple has thoroughly documented how the beta software works and/or intends to work which makes it concrete, shipping (for some) and answerable without regard to violating an NDA should one even exist between Apple and the OP/Answerers.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/193368/\">What is the &quot;rootless&quot; feature in El Capitan, really?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/191421/\">Can I make my own kernel extensions on El Capitan?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/190855/\">OS X El Capitan find mouse dosen&#39;t work with external mouse</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/190826/\">How do I use Split View in OS X 10.11 El Capitan?</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All of the above are answerable, clear, useful IMO.</p>\n\n<p>We have all the close reasons to handle vague questions, too broad questions, and basic customer support questions for beta builds as well as we do for normal builds. Adding beta to a bad question still means we will close it with prejudice. However, I believe the quality of questions on the site will rise if we make this change since we are selecting for the most active users of Apple products. I welcome people asking about OS 9 and older technology and want to also welcome people that have legitimate questions about using any Apple product or service. Full stop.</p>\n\n<p>There clearly will be people uncomfortable with potentially violating their NDA and we will probably lose their input, but Apple is clearly putting their beta software in very wide audience. To wit, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/iwork-for-icloud/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Apples iWork for iCloud</a> is in beta and has been so since June 2013. <strong>We should allow questions on software that people use, and people are using Apples beta software widely.</strong> No NDA or paid developer account is needed to download Xcode 7, iWork in iCloud, or view any of the WWDC videos from this year. Yes, some people will participate in the <a href=\"https://appleseed.apple.com/sp/welcome\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">iOS and OS X AppleSeed customer seeding</a> or the <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/welcome\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Apple Beta Software Program</a> beta seeding program or the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/programs/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Apple Developer Program</a> and be encumbered with those agreements between them and Apple.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Is the public beta software confidential?</strong> Yes, the public beta software is Apple confidential information. Don t install the public\n  beta software on any systems you dont directly control or that you\n  share with others. Don t blog, post screen shots, tweet, or publicly\n  post information about the public beta software, and dont discuss the\n  public beta software with or demonstrate it to others who are not in\n  the Apple Beta Software Program. If Apple has publicly disclosed\n  technical information about the public beta software, it is no longer\n  considered confidential.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, participants should be totally in the clear if they are only discussing what Apple has publicly disclosed. Yes, people may find it harder to keep track of what is confidential and not - so each person will have to make a choice if they can keep track of things or just want to walk out of the room if they are uncomfortable with the topics being discussed like any adult should always feel empowered to do.</p>\n\n<p>Also, since we have tags and search terms to help us find beta software and flags for people to alert moderators - we can use the typical post notices to ask people to document their words with a public link or face removal.</p>\n\n<p>Also, Im still going to be voting to close questions about \"future\" betas, or \"future OS\" as described well in these two answers</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1115/\">Questions about OS X before it is released to the general public?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1332/\">Can I ask about not-yet-publicly released OS?</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Note that the problems with speculative questions (Will the final version do X, When will Apple do Y, Will this bug get fixed) are not unique to betas therefore allowing good beta questions will not allow bad questions (beta or not) in on this specific coat tail.</p>\n\n<p>I look forward to hearing from any community organizers, interested parties, or past/present moderators if they see any issues with my listing of \"facts\" as well as my opinions expressed here in favor of \"lifting the ban\" on beta posts pretty much immediately. I would expect us to all monitor things until later this fall fall to see whether we were too hasty or if this change fits in with both Apple in 2015 and our community of users in 2015.</p>\n','5472','-1',NULL,'2017-04-13T12:45:27.673','2015-07-13T20:06:11.720',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,5,NULL,NULL),(2542,'1',NULL,NULL,'2015-06-26T23:17:29.717',3,67,'<p>I was thinking how it would be nice if syntax highlighting for AppleScript used in code blocks was a little more appropriate.

Thus, flagging as VLQ is one way to bring the answer to the attention of other 10K users, who can then downvote it and vote to delete.  Recall that deleting an answer requires multiple \"delete\" votes from 10K users.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, if we want ordinary users to clean up the site, the challenge with doing that is coordination: we need a way to notify multiple 10K users about the answer, so they can take a look, see if they agree, and if they do, vote to delete.  Right now, flagging as VLQ or NAA is one of the few ways to do that, and arguably the best way to do so.</p>\n\n<p>So, flagging as VLQ serves two purposes: (1) to notify  -moderators, and (2) to notify 10K users.  I can sympathize with  -moderators who dont want to be put in a position of being asked to judge the technical accuracy of answers and who feel this is best left up to the community.  However, I think theres a case to be made for encouraging \"flag-as-VLQ\" in this kind of case, because it allows 10K users (regular users) to police the site -- flag-as-VLQ + the VLQ review queue is one of the best tools the community has to police this on their own, without bringing in  -moderators.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, in this kind of situation, there might be a case for having  -moderators leave the VLQ flag live and letting 10K users handle it as they see fit.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Ill also point out that the text under the VLQ flag says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This answer has severe formatting or content problems. This answer is unlikely to be salvageable through editing, and might need to be removed. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think that does accurately characterize this answer: the answer is unlikely to be salvageable through editing, and probably needs to be removed.  Therefore, I think the VLQ flag was appropriate, and Im not sure it should have been declined.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In your specific case, I think it would also have been reasonable to flag the answer as NAA (not an answer).  The \"answer\" doesnt even attempt to answer the question -- it consists of disjointed statements, none of which answer the question (as <a href=\"https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2539/conspiracy-theory-answer-flagged-disputed#comment5740_2540\">youve already accurately analyzed</a>).  As an aside: Ideally, when you flag as NAA, its helpful to leave a comment explaining why, so that when moderators or 10K users see the flag, they have some justification for why it was flagged, and also so that the user has a chance to understand why their answer was unsuitable and either edit it or do things differently in the future.</p>\n\n<p>So, in this case, I personally feel like both a NAA flag and a VLQ flag are justified.  To me, it feels like there are multiple reasons why this answer should be deleted: both because it doesnt attempt to answer the question, and because it has severe content problems and probably cant be salvaged through editing.</p>\n\n<p>So, ultimately, Im very sympathetic to you: I dont think you were wrong to flag the comment, and I probably would have flagged it, too, if Id come across it.</p>\n','24154','-1',NULL,'2017-03-16T15:45:18.967','2015-07-03T01:49:00.053',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL),(2553,'1',NULL,'2554','2015-07-04T09:41:03.017',5,54,'<p>Im a reasonably seasoned user over on on Stack Overflow, so I know a single downvote is no big deal, and people can vote however they like and have no obligation to explain why; thats fine.

Editing privilege: the site bumps questions that get edited, so the intent behind the two person is that a question has to be good enough for 2 different people to care about it for an edit to change. This minimizes the trivial edits and maximizes eyes on one persons attempt to change things. Editing comes lower than review - so change there can be malicious, with good intent but bad effect, with bad intent but good result and a genuinely positive change. The second editor then needs to uphold the change the first did.</p>\n\n<p>Review is a bit higher in rep so you have more latitude to choose what to approve and step in to change things.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, at 2k reputation you can edit a post yourself.</p>\n\n<p>The help page for this is: <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/edit\">https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/edit</a></p>\n\n<p>So - you are allowed to edit a post for grammar and clarity, so fixing all caps is clearly encouraged and allowed. However, I have generally declined to edit a question that is so poorly presented. If the OP cares so little about learning and adhering to the way people have chosen to compose thoughts here that their post is ALL CAPS, I find that generally the question isnt good enough quality for my time to edit it. Id rather focus my volunteer time on posts that need less caring and attention to be useful to the site.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, the main question is do you see enough promise in that post to wade in and do the work needed to make it look good. The phrases \"polishing a turd\" or \"putting lipstick on a chicken\" come to mind. After thousands of edits, Im not so concerned with fixing all the things but instead fixing things I feel need a better presentation since they are of a higher value to be answered or presented properly.</p>\n\n<p>Theres no one right philosophy though - the site depends on hundreds of editors, each with their preferences about what makes them happy to keep the place running smoothly. If your OCD results in these posts being cleaned up, Im a big fan of your efforts. If not, Ill probably be a fan of what other things you choose to do.</p>\n\n<p>HTH - TLDR - <em>if you are allowed to edit and care to edit</em>, <strong>go ahead and do it</strong>.

As such, we can now restart the Community Promotion Ads for 2016!</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind, we have updated some of the guidelines compared to previously - the changes are marked in bold in the Image Requirements section.</p>\n\n<h3>What are Community Promotion Ads?</h3>\n\n<p>Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>\n\n<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>\n\n<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>interesting apple related open source apps</li>\n<li>the sites twitter account</li>\n<li>script packs or power tools</li>\n<li>cool events or conferences</li>\n<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own communitys interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>\n\n<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>\n\n<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>\n\n<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>\n\n<h3>How does it work?</h3>\n\n<p>The answers you post to this question <em>must</em> conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>All answers should be in the exact form of:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]\n\n   [1]: http://image-url\n   [2]: http://clickthrough-url \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Please <strong>do not add anything else to the body of the post</strong>.

(This is fine, of course; not everyone needs to learn the command line.  We have those people at Unix &amp; Linux also.)  This isnt the sort of answer thats considered \"good\" on U&amp;L.  Its probably not considered \"good\" here, either!  But in-depth answers about the command line are really the <em>norm</em> on U&amp;L.  So if you have a tricky, highly technical command line question, U&amp;L is (in my opinion) the best place possible to ask.</p>\n\n<p>However what goes along with this is <em>possibly</em> less lenience for newbie questions.  Its really hard to describe this, though, because no one is <em>rude</em> about it...Ive rewritten this paragraph five times and I still cant quite nail it.</p>\n\n<p>I suppose the closest I could come is to say: imagine the response of a bunch of (polite) doctors who were sitting and chatting if you came in and asked, \"I forget, is it the ears or the eyes that are the sight organs?\"  Theyd answer you, of course, but they would undoubtedly be amused and might even chuckle at your naivet .  :)</p>\n\n<p>So really, ask where you feel comfortable asking, and where you think you will get the best answer.  Either way its on topic.</p>\n','151730','-1',NULL,'2017-04-13T12:37:07.007','2016-01-21T02:06:00.967',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,0,NULL,NULL),(2727,'2','2714',NULL,'2016-01-22T04:05:38.033',1,NULL,'<p>My two cents on this, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3446231/how-close-are-mac-os-x-and-bsd-related\">since Mac OS/X is based on BSD</a> there is enough subtle difference between how commands work in a OS/X Terminal vs. a Linux-derived terminal. Because of this I would recommend allowing general purpose OS/X Terminal command questions here.</p>\n\n<p>Having said that, when I worked for Applecare, first-tier support advisors are NOT allowed to freelance on the command-line, they are only allowed to use terminal commands if they come from an official Apple support doc, and thats rare!</p>\n\n<p>Once I graduated to tier 2 (\"Senior Advisor\") I thought, woohoo I can solve problems a lot faster! Well there was more freedom (and depends on your manager) but there was still a strong emphasis on solutions the customers could understand that used GUI tools. True, customers get ahead of support agents and can do some damage when they \"know enough to be dangerous,\" so keeping them away from the command line was generally the right thing to do ... until I talked to a customer who I knew was smarter than me :)</p>\n\n<p>Well I only rehash that (no longer work there) to point out <strong>that Apple culture is, as noted in other answers, generally to stay away from the command line.</strong></p>\n\n<p>But having said all that my original point stands, <a href=\"https://askubuntu.com/questions/484982/what-is-the-difference-between-standard-syntax-and-bsd-syntax\">and there is enough difference between BSD and Linux</a> that the content can be reasonably dissimilar.

Answers about how to search for files in Panther before Spotlight was introduced arent obsolete; they just dont apply to people who choose to use those newfangled gizmos.</p>\n','9388',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2016-03-13T16:59:28.253',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,NULL,NULL),(2751,'1',NULL,'2752','2016-03-14T19:29:57.347',3,98,'<p>The <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hackintosh\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;hackintosh&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">hackintosh</a> tag refers to using Apple operating systems on non-Apple hardware.

Theres good prior art for this sort of thing on the site.</p>\n\n<p>And a slight diversion here: answering your own questions is not only okay, its <em>encouraged</em> by the Stack Exchange system. You have an \"answer your own question\" box right below the \"ask your question\" box when youre creating a new question. Stack Exchange exists to capture questions and answers with as few rules as possible. Sometimes people know the question <em>and</em> the answer and why wouldnt we want them to share this knowledge with the world?</p>\n\n<p>However, for the second question you linked to, <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/231833/what-are-the-differences-between-the-9-7-and-12-9-ipad-pros\">What are the differences between the 9.7  and 12.9  iPad Pros?</a> -- the asker did not provide an answer.

We certainly dont mind simple or easy-to-answer questions!</p>\n\n<p>I will say that your answer on the \"What are the differences between the 9.7  and 12.9  iPad Pros?\" is not a good answer. We strongly discourage \"read the text behind a link\" answers here. Links rot, which means the text behind them gets lots. Pull the relevant details in to your answer in addition to providing the link would make it a stronger answer.

This was their response:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In this case, no flag at all :-) It clearly is an answer, and salvageable by editing, so what would you expect a mod to do here which you cant do yourself?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><sup>The first part is debatable. It was discussed in numerous meta posts on other sites and the consensus seems to be on the side of \"do flag link-only answers as a non-answers\" with this nice <a href=\"https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/225370/305121\">infographic</a> as an example.</sup></p>\n\n<p>I am puzzled with the latter part of the response:</p>\n\n<p>So far I thought moderators attention is required when flagging a post <em>for moderators attention</em>, as <em>a spam</em>, or as <em>rude-or-offensive</em> (with the latter two flags causing deletion also by majority of votes).</p>\n\n<p>However I had an impression that flagging as <em>low quality</em> or flagging as a <em>non-answer</em> directed such posts to the Low Quality Posts review queue where >2000 rep. users could vote for deletion and publish an automatic comment explaining the rules. On all sites on which I have access to these queues, there is an explicit option \"this is a link-only answer and not spam\" which is not available when flagging.</p>\n\n<p>I thought that by flagging an answer as <em>non-answer</em> or <em>low-quality</em>, I am bringing it to the attention of the community (which gives opportunity to post predefined suggestions, give author time and put an answer subject to democratic voting) not moderators (at least not in the first place).</p>\n\n<p>Is it different on Ask Different?</p>\n\n<p>Why a moderator here suggests that by flagging this post I might have had any expectations of them (\"<em>what would you expect a mod to do here</em>\")?</p>\n','145449','-1',NULL,'2017-03-20T10:29:37.673','2016-06-07T12:44:36.593',NULL,NULL,'Should we flag different on Ask Different?','<discussion><flagging>',1,6,NULL,NULL),(2802,'2','2801',NULL,'2016-06-07T12:44:36.593',1,NULL,'<p>I cant speak for how other sites handle link only flags - but the post you mentioned doesnt seem to meet our standards for general flagging.</p>\n\n<p>If you read <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/flagging\">https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/flagging</a> it explains that the primary reason to flag is when you see something bad.</p>\n\n<p>I see no guidance on the site help here where link only answers are prohibited - just as we dont prohibit wrong answers. Those sort of things are designed to be handled through two processes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Reputation limits make people participate in ways that others will vote and comment when their initial efforts are outside the site norms or objectively not useful. </li>\n<li>Closure and voting and peer moderation handle almost all the cases of people figuring out how to contribute when they dont read the help center on how to make a good question or how to show research.

They can have the same hardware/software/version and the application of the answer(s) have broad appeal.  Once we start accepting very limited, almost singularly-focused, questions, we lose the broad-base.  Sure, it will help the person asking the question but the odds are very high that it will <em>only</em> help that person and none other.  If thats where we, the community, and SE, the owners, want to focus our efforts then thats ok; we just need to be aware of the potential downside to doing that.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding my point #2, almost every hackintosh question Ive seen in my time here has had some part of this mix-and-match type of question.  There could be 1, 10, or a 100 reasons why the OPs particular mix of parts will not work and that could lead us down the a road for days before we realize that where we are has nothing to do with the lone Apple OS theyre using.  Once again, while it might help that one OP that one time, its probably not going to help others at any time (I said probably so please dont accuse me of saying never).  </p>\n\n<p>I think where the mods and community are now has taken is a very good place and it helps more people in its current state that it will if changed for this, specific reason.</p>\n','88313','-1',NULL,'2017-04-13T12:45:27.673','2016-10-23T13:45:52.103',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL),(2885,'2','2882',NULL,'2016-10-19T15:12:40.940',-1,NULL,'<p>Currently the wording in the help center says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Installing or using Apple operating systems on non-Apple hardware</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>which may be too strict for a lot of situations.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Installing</em> macOS on non-Apple hardware is usually a rather challenging endeavour which requires the right combination of hardware components etc. There are some sites dedicated to these kind of challenges, and the community there is much better suited to help people than AD users can ever be</li>\n<li><em>Using</em> macOS on non-Apple hardware on the other hand isnt too different from using it on Apple hardware.

Im open to re-evaluating them if needed. </p>\n\n<p>To incorporate your excellent comments below - there are discussions similar to ours on the main meta:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/207962/could-we-have-some-consensus-on-how-to-flag-bunches-of-obsolete-comments\">Could we have some consensus on how to flag bunches of obsolete comments?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/182684/flagging-obsolete-comment-conversations\">Flagging obsolete comment conversations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/261009/cmon-please-give-us-a-hint-how-authoritative-is-that-obsolete-comment-flag\">C&#39;mon, please give us a hint: how authoritative is that &quot;obsolete comment&quot; flag?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/252844/make-comment-flags-less-stupid\">Make comment flags less stupid</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The first two share your confusion / dis-satisfaction on the process and you are not alone / wrong from my standpoint.

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>\n\n<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>\n\n<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>interesting apple related open source apps</li>\n<li>the sites twitter account</li>\n<li>script packs or power tools</li>\n<li>cool events or conferences</li>\n<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own communitys interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>\n\n<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>\n\n<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>\n\n<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>\n\n<h3>How does it work?</h3>\n\n<p>The answers you post to this question <em>must</em> conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>All answers should be in the exact form of:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]\n\n   [1]: http://image-url\n   [2]: http://clickthrough-url \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Please <strong>do not add anything else to the body of the post</strong>.

Theres really very little reason to take on the certificate complexity and cost to add these additional domains.</p>\n\n<p>Not that being said, this will eventually happen anyway for other reasons. As simply as a side-effect of us shuffling redirects between <a href=\"https://www.name.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">name.com</a> servers and <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Cloudflare</a> for redirects. We did this for <a href=\"https://miyodeya.com\">miyodeya.com</a> for the purposes of <em>existing</em> SE 1.0 links - since they ever existed, not supporting this on name.coms redirect service was causing (effectively) 404s to actual content.</p>\n\n<p>We moved them to our miscellaneous Cloudflare account for the purposes of redirects, supporting <code>https://</code> is only a side-effect. But, maintaining 2 ways of doing something when 1 is saner/easier (were almost done automating this) is just silly. So the plan is to move all these domains to Cloudflare.

And, for a while we even had a series of Ask Different <a href=\"http://apple.blogoverflow.com/category/podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">podcasts</a> being produced.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I am <strong>not</strong> saying we should go back to running competitions and offering prizes, or producing podcasts (I know these things require time and money), but my point is that presumably at some point the blog was quite active and successful (it even had a dedicated Ask Different <a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/1408/ask-different-blog\">Blog chat</a>). And it <em>may</em> have even been a good promotional/marketing tool for Ask Different as a whole (e.g. this Ask Different <a href=\"http://apple.blogoverflow.com/2012/03/keyboard-ninja-working-with-text-screencast/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">screencast</a> on Vimeo seems to have been a <em>Vimeo staff pick</em> at one time). </p>\n\n<p>My questions are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Do we actually still have a blog?</li>\n<li>If no, (i) when did it stop; and (ii) why did it stop (i.e. low readership, not enough contributors, etc)?</li>\n<li>If yes, (i) how do we get involved; and (ii) how can we promote it?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In summary, it seems to me that getting the blog going again <em>may be possible</em> as weve got more users joining the site daily and some of these have been very active in the period since the last blog post.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I for one would be more than happy to get involved.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>[UPDATE 1]</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since posting the question Ive found and discovered some history to all this.</p>\n\n<p>This blog... </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...was originally a part of Blog Overflow, a network of blogs linked to\n  Stack Exchange sites.

We only migrate questions because they are off-topic on the original site. It is perfectly possible for a question to be on-topic on multiple sites, but that is not a reason to migrate it elsewhere, unless the OP requests migration. As a general rule, if someone asks a question here, and its on-topic here, it should stay here.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/10249/222623\">What is migration and how does it work?</a></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, though, Ask Different goes against this guideline   due to the low-traffic nature of some parts of this site, it may be beneficial to the question for it to be elsewhere.

If he is in violation of the \"Be Nice\" policy, and is coming off as just plain rude, I will probably issue a temporary suspension.

The moderators on this site are extremely knowledgeable on Apple topics and contribute greatly to providing answers, directly helping people who come to the site looking for help with their issue.

The tagging system is a reasonable way to find questions in a certain category, but at the moment it s not an excellent way. Inappropriate use of tags is one thing and is regularly fixed through editing, but there are plenty of other structural tag issues, many of which lead to the incorrect tagging. I regularly <a href=\"https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/search?tab=newest&amp;q=user%3a37797%20%5btags%5d%20is%3aquestion\">raise issues with tags on meta</a>, but understandably there doesn t seem to be much priority placed on them, exemplified by the regular automatic freezing of the tag chat room due to inactivity. The existing tools for dealing with this are unused by the majority: there s barely a single tag synonym vote, let alone a synonym which went through without mod intervention. Yet despite this, tags are used by a large number of people to track and subscribe to various topics, so I think more could be done with improving how tags are organised on the site with proper synonyms and tag wiki.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"6\">\n  <li>Since being a moderator requires you to commit a significant amount of your time, as well as having to perform a number of <em>mundane</em> activities, I am wondering why youve nominated for this role?

I am extremely grateful of the work the moderator team has done, both behind the scenes and in their contributions to Q&amp;A, both of which lead me like many others to discover this site and what it has to offer. A very minor point I could raise for this question would be that, in more recent years, there are occasional lapses in the level of communication over meta posts on topics brought up by the community. I m sure with the addition of moderators from this election, in an effort to continue the excellent work of those departed over the years, will bring a temperate faster pace.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"8\">\n  <li>A question is asked and receives some very good answers.

Situations like the one given in the question make users feel frustrated and encourage them to pursue other options. I would remove inappropriate comments from the post and work with the person to refine their question. Chat is a good place for this and in my opinion is under-utilised on Ask Different for helping people with such issues. There is a difference between someone not knowing how to start with a question despite much research, and someone unwilling to put in the effort in the first place to try   chat is a good way to provide pointers in the right direction either way, such that the question and therefore the problem can be rectified.</p>\n','37797',NULL,NULL,NULL,'2017-06-28T13:07:17.267',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,NULL,NULL),(3087,'2','3083',NULL,'2017-06-30T05:01:17.757',9,NULL,'<p><a href=\"https://stackexchange.com/users/5474807\">\n<img src=\"https://stackexchange.com/users/flair/5474807.png?theme=clean\" width=\"208\" height=\"58\" alt=\"profile for Monomeeth on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites\" title=\"profile for Monomeeth on Stack Exchange, a network of free, community-driven Q&amp;A sites\">\n</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My first point of call would be to touch base with our existing moderators.

My hope would be that this approach will achieve a win-win situation for the community as a whole.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"2\">\n  <li>How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldnt have been?</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I ve always been a team player and get along with most people, so I would just ask them about it. This way we d quickly establish what their reasoning was and, if I had an alternative view, I d be able to express that as well. If an error was made I m sure the other mod would change it themselves. In the end, I think we d generally reach a consensus one way or the other. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"3\">\n  <li><p>As a moderator, your votes become binding. Actions you used to take like flagging, closing, and deleting will take effect immediately without any input from any other users or moderators.</p>\n  \n  <p>How will you adapt the way you currently flag and vote to deal with this change?</p></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I always try to take a Stop-Think-Do approach to most things, so I don t think I ll need to adapt how I currently flag and vote. In fact, 99% of all my flags have been rated as <em>helpful</em> by the existing mods. I m happy with that and hope to continue that standard regardless of whether Im elected as a moderator.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"4\">\n  <li>In addition to <em>moderation</em> activities (e.g. dealing with flagged posts, deleting spam, etc), what other role do you see that moderators can play to improve the overall success of our community?</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My view is that the number 1 thing moderators can do is to lead by example.</p>\n\n<p>Some ways of doing this are easy to measure (e.g. answering questions, dealing with flags, deleting spam, editing posts, and so on).</p>\n\n<p>Other ways are not so obvious. </p>\n\n<p>For example, I think moderators have a role to play trying to calm things down if they come across a heated debate in comments (e.g. posting a comment like <em>I think it s great you re all so passionate, but can we please agree to focus on the specifics of the question rather than getting bogged down in a debate about </em>). </p>\n\n<p>This type of thing is hard to measure, but its definitely a role that moderators can play.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"5\">\n  <li>As a user of this site, what would you say is the number one issue we face moving forward? And, do you have any thoughts on how we tackle that issue?</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>George (@grgarside) has already raised the issue of tags and I tend to agree as I find myself regularly changing the tags used on questions. So I like what George has to say about this and would support his approach.</p>\n\n<p>However, for me the number one issue is improving engagement between users and the site. Ill try and explain what I m getting at:</p>\n\n<p>Since its launch, Ask Different has had over 164,000 registered users. Of these, only 0.024% of them have ever reached a reputation score of 200. Using the last 30 days as an example, we ve had 2,930 new registrations in that time. Of these, 2,540 (86.7%) were totally new to the Stack Exchange network. Unfortunately, only 180 (that s 0.07%) of these now have a reputation above 1.</p>\n\n<p>Now, how is this the case? Is it just that the site has an issue of low voting? Or, is it because the overwhelming majority of new users don t ask and/or answer questions? </p>\n\n<p>For me, the only way to tackle this type of thing is to measure it. I believe if we can measure it, we can improve it. So if I m elected as a moderator one of my side projects would be to really start measuring/analysing site usage and trying to work back from there. If it s clear that we need to encourage voting, then we d try to find ways to educate users on how important voting is. If it s something else, then we tackle that. </p>\n\n<p>This is just one issue (e.g. about one-third of the sites questions - thats over 26,000 - remain unanswered, likewise many questions/answers have no votes whatsoever, and so on).</p>\n\n<p>The point is, unless we do the analysis to begin with, how will we ever know? </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"6\">\n  <li>Since being a moderator requires you to commit a significant amount of your time, as well as having to perform a number of <em>mundane</em> activities, I am wondering why youve nominated for this role? What is it you feel you have to offer that makes you worthy of our trust?</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I ve just checked and I ve been active on the site for 444 days, and I ve actually visited the site for the last 300 consecutive days. So I guess I m already investing a fair bit of my time here. </p>\n\n<p>If I m elected, it ll probably be more about how I reprioritise that time. In terms of mundane activities, well, I ve already been doing most of these types of things anyway (reviews, edits, flagging, etc), as I m sure many other users can relate to as well.</p>\n\n<p>So I m putting myself forward because I feel I can contribute to the success and growth of the site. For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I have an analytical mind and like measuring things to see how we can do them better. As a user I ve already started thinking about the site and how it s being used. </li>\n<li>I m already contemplating ways to improve engagement. For examples, see these meta posts: <a href=\"https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3041/168832\">WWDC Keynote Live Chat Event</a>  and <a href=\"https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3036/168832\">Ask Different Blog</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>So, why am I worthy of your trust?</strong></p>\n\n<p>For starters, this is not a power grab for me. I hadnt considered nominating for a moderator until recently when one of the current moderators mentioned they hoped I d volunteer. So for me, being a moderator isn t something Ive been working towards for any sort of personal gain, or just as part of some sort of ego trip - its really more a calling to serve.</p>\n\n<p>Along with many of you, I have dedicated a lot of time to making this site the wonderful resource it is. Anyone here can go back and read the entire history of my <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/168832/monomeeth?tab=answers\">answers</a> and/or <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/168832/monomeeth?tab=activity&amp;sort=comments\">comments</a> and see for themselves that I ve always tried to help users, and I m not shy to encourage them. I m also a prolific voter of both questions and answers, regardless of whether the user was above or below me in the ranks. </p>\n\n<p>Other examples of me putting the site first include my volunteering to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>allow <a href=\"https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/291301/can-a-machine-be-taught-to-flag-spam-automatically?cb=1\">Smoke Detector</a> to use my account to flag spam automatically</li>\n<li>be part of the <a href=\"https://crowdcrafting.org/project/sehttpimagescleanup/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">crowdcrafting effort</a> to cleanup Stack Exchange s HTTP images.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>While the above doesn t necessarily prove I m worthy of your trust, it does show my motivations have been to put the site first.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"7\">\n  <li>If there is one thing you could/would like to change in the way the site is moderated, what would it be?</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The current moderators do a fantastic job. So much so that when this election was called, my first reaction was to jump straight into Chat and ask why we were having an election. That s because things generally run very well.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are two things that could be improved:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Having more time to manage meta posts, as some of these do require a bit of follow-up work. Sometimes these are followed up pretty quickly, and other times they re left sitting there with no real resolution. I do not blame the current moderators for this, I genuinely believe this is just a consequence of the fact we ve only had <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/users?tab=moderators\">four moderators</a> for quite a while now. By way of comparison, the <a href=\"https://mathoverflow.net/users?tab=moderators\">MathOverflow</a> site basically has the same number of questions and answers as we do, but has seven active moderators.</p></li>\n<li><p>Having a moderator presence on a 24/7 basis whenever possible. At present we have four moderators, three based in the US and one in Europe. As someone who lives in Australia, I regularly find there s a bit of a gap in terms of coverage. This isn t usually a problem as we all have a role to play in moderation, but if we had some more time zones covered it can only be a good thing.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The first point, and maybe even the second, will be rectified simply by having these elections.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"8\">\n  <li>A question is asked and receives some very good answers. The asker then flags this question and asks for it to be deleted because having it up will cause them trouble at work or school. Do you delete the question?</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The short answer is no, especially since users have gone to the trouble to provide some very good answers. Instead, I d invite the OP into chat and ask them what specifically could create problems for them. This allows us to address the issue. For example, the question itself can be edited to remove any offending elements. Likewise, the OP s profile can be edited to remove any identifying information. Regardless, I m sure we d be able to find a resolution that didn t require the need to delete the question.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"9\">\n  <li>A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I d feel no different to how I do now.</p>\n\n<p>As I mentioned previously, anyone can go back and read the entire history of my <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/168832/monomeeth?tab=answers\">answers</a>,  <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/168832/monomeeth?tab=activity&amp;sort=comments\">comments</a> etc, and see for themselves that I ve always conducted myself appropriately.

Any inappropriate comments would be deleted and I d apologise on behalf of the community for any offence caused. \nFinally, I would try to help the user to reformulate their question so we could get things back on track.</p>\n','168832','168832',NULL,'2017-06-30T11:48:28.263','2017-06-30T11:48:28.263',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,NULL,NULL),(3088,'2','3083',NULL,'2017-07-02T11:31:05.587',7,NULL,'<p>Here are my (<a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/election/4#post-288564\">Glorfindel</a>s) answers to your questions:</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"/help/be-nice\">Be Nice</a> is very important to the success of Stack Exchange; more important than posting good answers (or questions, for that matter). Id remind this user (in a polite but strict way) to change their behaviour or face the consequences in the form of a suspension. There are enough other users who can write those valuable answers instead.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"2\">\n  <li>How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldnt have been?</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Id discuss this with them in a private chatroom. I might bring in a third (or fourth) moderator as well if I feel we need to make a tough decision, so that it can be a decision of a majority. Theres no need doing this in public and risk harming the trust the community has in the moderator team.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"3\">\n  <li><p>As a moderator, your votes become binding.

My job as a moderator would be mainly to <em>guide</em> that, and not make unilateral decisions, unless strictly necessary. A   moderator is a <em>representative</em> of the community, not a <em>ruler</em>; if the community thinks something is worth keeping (open), Im willing to forego my personal opinions. Id probably end up <kbd>Skip</kbd>ping more reviews than I usually do.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"4\">\n  <li>In addition to <em>moderation</em> activities (e.g. dealing with flagged posts, deleting spam, etc), what other role do you see that moderators can play to improve the overall success of our community?</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The following isnt limited to moderators; it concerns all users. But I believe moderators should lead by example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Increase participation\n\n<ul>\n<li>This starts with welcoming other users, so that theyre more likely to stick around.</li>\n<li>\"Being nice\" helps tremendously in the long run.</li>\n<li>Im not necessarily trying to draw people away from Super User, but I see a lot of Mac questions there that would fit here perfectly.</li>\n<li>I like the idea of organizing chat events around Apples keynotes.

(I cant think of something specific right now, to be honest.)</li>\n<li>Sometimes, we spot certain trends (e.g. a sudden spike in the number of questions about a single topic). We should think of a solution (e.g. creating one or two canonical questions) and propose this on Meta, so that the community can chime in and decide.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"5\">\n  <li>As a user of this site, what would you say is the number one issue we face moving forward? And, do you have any thoughts on how we tackle that issue?</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We have a very low (69%) of <a href=\"https://stackexchange.com/sites#percentanswered\">questions which are answered</a> &lt;-- you have to scroll down a bit, alas. For comparison: one of the (not always enforced) criteria for graduation of a beta site is that it must have an answered percentage of at least 80%. 90% or higher is considered healthy.</p>\n\n<p>This can have two possible reasons: we have too many questions, or too few people able to answer those questions (or close them as a duplicate of a canonical question   closed questions dont count in that metric). If its the first, we should focus on increasing the chance that a (new) user is able to solve his/her problem with the vast number of questions we already have. The second is probably harder, and would mean we probably need more knowledgeable people here.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"6\">\n  <li>Since being a moderator requires you to commit a significant amount of your time, as well as having to perform a number of <em>mundane</em> activities, I am wondering why youve nominated for this role?

I have been doing a lot of mundane tasks <em>behind the scenes</em>; not being in the spotlight works right for 95% of the time. For the other 5%, its useful to have a   behind your name. Im offering to work hard, just as Ive done in the past.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"7\">\n  <li>If there is one thing you could/would like to change in the way the site is moderated, what would it be?</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I dont think major changes are needed. Sometimes, my Not-An-Answer flags on \"Im having the same problem, did you solve it?\" take quite long to be processed, but I guess the election will take care of this, by increasing the number of moderators and the hours that they are available. (And to be honest, those posts are annoying but not really harmful.)</p>\n\n<p>I mentioned some areas in need of attention under point 4, but those do not really fall under <em>moderation</em>, and are shared responsibilities between the   moderators and other community members.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"8\">\n  <li>A question is asked and receives some very good answers.

Id explain that to the user (licenses can be tricky material) and ask them to submit a <em>disassociation request</em> via the contact us form (that can only be performed by Stack Overflow staff, not by  s). This will keep the valuable content but remove the association with the user. In addition, if the post contains Personally Identifiable Information, Ill redact it if necessary (so that it doesnt end up in the revision history).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"9\">\n  <li>A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments.

I always try to Be Nice to all people, even if I think they have bad ideas or opinions which I can outright refute. <strong>Respect</strong> is the keyword for building a community where everybody is welcome.

How do we signal that the question is unanswered for a specific version of macOS?

From Mavericks (10.9) to High Sierra shipping today (10.14), thats 5 different versions (not including the minor upgrades).  </p>\n\n<p>Why would we need 5 different questions/answers for the same thing if the question/answer are still relevant?</p>\n\n<p>Going further, if the question is \"different\" because of the hardware being is is older further adds to number of permutations.    Just doing a cursory check the MBP goes back to 2006 and has about 20 major versions (i.e. Mid-2011) excluding the sizes (13\", 15\", 17\") and options (i.e. Retina, TouchBar, etc.)  </p>\n\n<p>Would we need to have 100 different permutations of the same question/answer because the hardware/software combo is older/different?  I think it would be illogical and inefficient to have a separate question for each possibility even if limited to only the major releases of hardware/software.</p>\n\n<h3>Reopening Closed Questions</h3>\n\n<p>As this is community driven, we do make mistakes and close things for many reasons including marking questions as dupes when they are in fact not.  For instance, in <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/290765/how-do-i-get-os-x-10-11-6-to-return-my-free-space\">this question</a> asked within the last 30 days, it was marked as a dupe but reopened because the OP added the following clarification:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This isnt the same question as the proposed duplicated, at all. I am\n  not suggesting that anything is eating my disk space. Im also not\n  saying that restarting it changes anything. Im stating that the disk\n  util says I have 300 GB free, which is likely the case given what I\n  deleted, and the OS says ~90 GB free, an amount that did not change as\n  I was deleting things and did not change when restarting the\n  system...so basically the freed space was not given back.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As is the case with your question.  Its entirely possible that your question <em>isnt</em> a duplicate, but until you rule out the solution(s) already provided for the previously asked question, its a duplicate.</p>\n\n<h3>Updating the previously asked question</h3>\n\n<p>Being a community site, its encouraged to edit questions/answers to make them more accurate (without trying to change the authors intent).  For example, if the previous question/answer was (not) a solution to your issue, you could edit the answer with a single line saying:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Update as of some date:  This is confirmed to (not) work in mac OS Sierra (10.13.x).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Asking a new question wouldnt be considered a dupe at that point and you would be contributing back to the community by keeping the original question relevant.</p>\n\n<p>To address your comment:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So your suggestion is essentially to try every one of the many broken\n  answers in the dupe and then ask a new question if none of them work?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask\">Help Center</a> addresses that concern:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Have you thoroughly searched for an answer before asking your\n  question? Sharing your research helps everyone. Tell us what you found\n  and why it didn t meet your needs. This demonstrates that you ve taken\n  the time to try to help yourself, it saves us from reiterating obvious\n  answers, and above all, it helps you get a more specific and relevant\n  answer!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If the answer is works or is broken, you can <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/help/why-vote\">up/down vote</a> and even add comments (i.e. \"This answer doesnt work for whatever reason\")</p>\n\n<p>The key is to reasonably attempt to research before generically stating a question is <strong>may</strong> not be relevant because its <strong>perceived</strong> to be obsolete.  </p>\n','119271','119271',NULL,'2017-08-12T13:52:29.810','2017-08-12T13:52:29.810',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,3,NULL,NULL),(3124,'2','3120',NULL,'2017-08-24T18:51:34.427',1,NULL,'<p>I think finding a solution for somebody is more relevant than hunting all (possible) duplicates down.

It may be quite well received and some people give good answers to how they understand the question. Question and/or answer get up votes. Now the original poster of the question realises that he was misunderstood, edits the question and the answers given do not really address the newly formulated question. Or the new question would now not be perceived as so interesting or valuable as the previous version. The votes remain the same. What was the point in editing it, now in relation to the votes to no longer fitting answers?</p>\n\n<p>Currently I do not see how this dynamic is addressed.</p>\n\n<p>This was regarding old posts. But it is also applicable to very new entries:\nIt seems to me that many votes are cast quite quickly, because someone likes or dislikes an answer or a question she just read. \nMy current impression: Quick voting is the first phase that accumulates votes fast but also dies down quickly. After the first votes the voting slows down considerably. </p>\n\n<p>This effect is contrary to how the system is explained to work. (Good content raises to the top bad sinks down.)</p>\n\n<p>If the example is a really fresh entry then diligence requires you to refine this (possibly your own) entry, based on comments, suggestions, better insight. But this is currently problematic:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>\"Likes or dislikes\" is purposely opinion based, I understand. But asking these opinion based questions is discouraged. Technical merit or correctness are not emphasised enough in this voting system. Wit and humour, grammatical prowess, or the lack of both, play a role here. So voting is very largely influenced by opinion. If opinion is mostly discouraged in questions and answers, the it should be minimised in voting.</p></li>\n<li><p>If these votes are cast before a fresh and still dynamic Q&amp;A is only half-way settled then the concerns raised above become even more important. These should self-correct automatically (through the system as designed). But they only do if they are still within the attention span of those involved so far. Seems that sometimes the individual attention span or how this site is used by the community arent really catering to that. This demotivates participants and muffles the discussion.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So, ideas for improvement or feature requests are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Differentiate in the temporal sense votes cast and edits thereafter. Or make an automated request to review votes if (substantial) editing took place. Or introduce a voting quarantine.</p></li>\n<li><p>Enable more feedback that encourages editing, improving the existing content. If this site is not only about answering but also about learning, then the feedback has to be more direct. This feedback will likely improve the overall quality on its own.</p></li>\n<li><p>Make it easier or explicitly possible to differentiate between likes and votes. The latter being based solely on technical correctness. (I understand that this might be either unwanted or even too late, given the content produced so far.)</p></li>\n</ol>\n','251859','251859',NULL,'2017-08-26T18:54:41.750','2017-08-26T18:54:41.750',NULL,NULL,'Voting vs Editing, are they at Odds in the Current System?','<feature-request><editing><voting>',1,2,NULL,NULL),(3126,'2','3125',NULL,'2017-08-26T15:50:03.497',1,NULL,'<p>The editing is mostly a way to avoid a large period of time where people would be inclined to down vote as opposed to remedy past impressions.
