At least then users would have the option of reviewing their vote in case theyd like to change it. However, an automatic ping raises problems without some sort of check and balance in place. For example, any automated pings should happen only after a certain amount of time has passed since the edit (lets say an hour), otherwise we could get a lot of pings while the edits are still in the progress of being made.','2017-08-27T00:49:14.043',168832,NULL),(6732,3126,0,'Also, how do we deal with the issue of *who* made the edit? For example, if someone wants to *vandalise* an answer in some subtle way for some sort of revengeful purpose, they could do that in the hope of reducing votes. So, how do we deal with that? Do we require the OP of the question/answer to have to accept the edit prior to any automated pings going out?
