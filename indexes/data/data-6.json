The educational value is potentially significant, not limited. The scope is narrow, but I don't think that is a valid reason to close, and the appeal may be limited, but maybe not.

I'm not sure the question would have been down-voted if it had remained open.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the official (not comment) reason for the closing does not apply. I fail to see how this question would solicit <code>debate, arguments, polling, or extended discussion</code>.

I think that since the \"group\" tag is very generic and can be used in a multitude of situations, maybe it should be removed and more specific group-related tags created \"Unix-group\", \"chat-group\"/\"group-conversation\", etc. This would remove the ambiguity surrounding some questions with that tag.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe there's a specific reason for allowing tags to be ambiguous that I'm not aware of, but to me it seems like we should either:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Remove generic tags</strong> and create <strong>more specific</strong> tags that are related (\"group\" -> \"unix-group\" + \"chat-group\").</li>\n<li><strong>Tag more accurately</strong>. For example, if I'm asking how to group windows, maybe I don't need to use a tag specifically dictating how I want to manage my windows; maybe I could just use a tag that's a little more general but not too broad like \"window-management\". </li>\n<li><strong>Write specific descriptions for new tags</strong>. This way, if I'm thinking about using the \"group\" tag, I can read the description and see if it applies to my question.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Again, if there's a specific reason for this tag ambiguity, I'd like to know, but otherwise, I believe that one of my three proposals should be put into place.

The downside to this is that such a list <em>could</em> become inaccurate quickly, depending on how updates to the software change the filesystem requirements. So if we wanted the list question, whoever answered it would need to curate it. This could work, but the site doesn't handle it ideally</p>\n\n<p>The second part asks for workarounds to make these programs work. This is actually a series of very good questions, each of which would be quite on-topic and welcome here on its own. If one work-around could work for all (or many) of the programs, the second part of the question could be a single question. If the fix tends to be program-speficic, this should be a separate question for each program one wants to get working under case-sensitive filesystems.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that a poster is tempted to post more than one answer is the first hint that it might not be a good fit for the Q&amp;A format. The issue is that our system is ideally designed to produce a single \"best\" answer that the OP can accept as correct. This question asks for some outstanding content, but is far from optimized for this site's Q&amp;A format. I believe it should be restructured (broken into parts), and each of the parts should be very much welcome and on-topic here.</p>\n","OwnerUserId":"9388","LastActivityDate":"2012-10-14T22:00:23.987","CommentCount":"1"},{"Id":"1480","PostTypeId":"2","ParentId":"1477","CreationDate":"2012-10-15T07:19:51.490","Score":"0","Body":"<p>My main objection to this question is that imo the community/Mac users are better served with a generic answer advising them against using a case-sensitive filesystem for installing <strong>any</strong> Mac application.

(Example: This pointed me to several very useful pieces of software, including helping make me aware about the existence of both Homebrew and MacPorts (previously I had only heard of MacPorts).)  I don't recommend closing it.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/17759/24154\">What tiny thing in Lion makes you smile or has caught you off guard?</a> - Not of value or interest to me.

I love the command line, so the concept is great, but the answers are not so great.  Most of the answers are lists of command-line programs (without explanation of why those are important or what they do).  That probably isn't super-helpful: if you know what the command-line program does, you already know whether you want/need it or not.  This <em>could</em> have been useful if it gave an overview to command-line programs that readers probably <em>weren't</em> already aware, and an explanation of what those programs do and why you need them ... but that's not this question. </p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/5435/24154\">Got any tips or tricks for Terminal in Mac OS X?</a> - I would not recommend closing a question that <em>so</em> many people have apparently found useful (going by the number of upvotes and favorites).  And some of the answers are useful and good stuff.  I found this to be a helpful resource, so I don't think the question should be closed.  (I see that it has been \"locked\".  I tend to think it should be unlocked.  I don't see any reason why it should remain locked or how it adds value to prevent others from updating their answer or adding new answers.  I'm not used to seeing \"locked\" questions and am not clear on how \"locked\" differs from \"closed\".)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These are just my personal opinions.

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.</p>\n\n<h3>Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?</h3>\n\n<p>This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>interesting apple related open source apps</li>\n<li>the site's twitter account</li>\n<li>script packs or power tools</li>\n<li>cool events or conferences</li>\n<li>anything else your community would genuinely be interested in</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The goal is for future visitors to find out about <em>the stuff your community deems important</em>. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are <em>relevant to your own community's interests</em>, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. </p>\n\n<h3>Why do we reset the ads every year?</h3>\n\n<p>Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.</p>\n\n<p>The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.</p>\n\n<h3>How does it work?</h3>\n\n<p>The answers you post to this question <em>must</em> conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>All answers should be in the exact form of:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]\n\n   [1]: http://image-url\n   [2]: http://clickthrough-url \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Please <strong>do not add anything else to the body of the post</strong>.
