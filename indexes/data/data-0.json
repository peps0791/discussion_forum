The real problem comes, not just when a question is subjective, but when it is subjective, and also <em>so open ended as to provide little value to someone who comes back and looks later</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, \"What Apps can't you live without\" is a Big Question. So big that lots of people are just going to end up listing everything on their dock, and 'accepting' an answer is going to be meaningless. By contrast, \"What is the best Twitter client for the iPhone?\" or \"<a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/122/what-is-the-best-media-player-for-the-mac-besides-mov-e-g-mp3-wmv-avi/138#138\">What is the best media player for OS X</a>?\", while subjective, are sufficiently narrow, that the person asking the question can select a best answer, and while others might reasonably disagree with that choice, the question can be said to have a single answer for the person that asked it.</p>\n","OwnerUserId":"43","LastEditorUserId":"-1","LastEditDate":"2017-04-13T12:45:27.043","LastActivityDate":"2010-08-17T22:57:18.993","CommentCount":"0"},{"Id":"31","PostTypeId":"2","ParentId":"14","CreationDate":"2010-08-17T23:16:58.883","Score":"4","Body":"<p>I know he's not even here yet, but Kyle Cronin might be a good candidate.

(These are things that people, starting from Jeff Atwood, seem to keep repeating even though what I've seen in practice at several SE sites doesn't necessarily support them at all...)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Don't scale</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some truth to it, but not <em>quite</em> so. The fact is that SE software is not <em>optimal</em> for polls with hundreds of answers, but it still <em>works</em>. Nothing crashes; new answers can be added; good stuff still is at the top; bad stuff gets down to the bottom. <em>How exactly</em> does it not scale?</p>\n\n<p>Sure, no-one reads <a href=\"https://superuser.com/questions/1191/what-are-some-must-have-mac-os-x-programs\">all of the 157 answers</a> to a poll about OS X programs at one sitting. So what? It can still <strong>very useful</strong>, for example to a person new to OS X who goes through the first 2-3 pages and find plenty of great ideas of what to install!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Noise\" - detract from more serious\n  questions</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is probably the strongest argument of those four. Big polls keep popping up on the front page with new answers and edits. Still: it is quite easy to ignore questions you don't like (but others like very much) and move on with your life. If a tag such as <code>[poll]</code> is used, those who want can even hide them completely. </p>\n\n<p>Even then polls would affect how <em>newcomers</em> perceive the site, right? Well yes, but not in any untruthful way. Don't worry about it too much. People are generally smart and benevolent enough (which is why Stack Overflow works, by the way).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Often are time restricted (become stale quickly)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some people love to repeat this, but fortunately it is not true at all. <strong>Community wiki polls on SE can stay perfectly dynamic, alive and up-to-date</strong>. This can be achieved with some active pruning and a couple of key features in the software platform. These features are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The voting system</strong>. Good stuff goes up, bad stuff (including duplicates and other worthless posts) goes down.</li>\n<li><strong>Ability to add new answers</strong>. </li>\n<li><strong>Ability to edit answers</strong> (by any trusted users)  </li>\n<li>Ability to delete answers \n\n<ul>\n<li>People who posted duplicates usually did it unwittingly, and can often be persuaded to remove such zero-value-adding posts</li>\n<li>Not as crucial, but still useful: moderators can prune away downvoted duplicates and other crap from the bottom, if they want to.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Ability to sort answers by votes <em>and</em> by date</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>A couple of <strong>use cases</strong>, with the <a href=\"https://superuser.com/questions/1191/what-are-some-must-have-mac-os-x-programs\">Mac application poll</a> as an example.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1)</strong> Let's say a new OS X app is released, 2 years after the poll was created. The app is absolutely fantastic. Someone goes on and adds an answer about it. Ok, it now has 0 votes and sits at the bottom. Does it get buried behind all the mediocre stuff? <strong>No.</strong> (Unless it deserves to.) Many knowledgeable users use the \"newest\" ordering when returning to look a poll question, and if they see good new stuff, they vote it up. If the new app truly is great, it will reach the first page in a few days or weeks, even if the poll has 6 to 8 pages of answers! </p>\n\n<p>If you don't believe me on that one, I can dig up evidence e.g. from some gigantic Stack Overflow poll; I've seen it happen often enough.</p>\n\n<p>It's sort of sad to see those useful questions (some of the community's most-liked questions, actually!) on Super User <a href=\"https://meta.superuser.com/questions/915/should-this-popular-cw-question-be-unlocked-to-allow-it-to-evolve\">locked</a> because <em>that</em> is exactly what kills them and makes them stale (no new answers can be added).</p>\n\n<p><strong>2)</strong> Let's say a relatively highly-voted app (e.g. Google Chrome) gets a slew of new features, transforming the key essence of that app (say, Google engineers pushed the limits further and it does your laundry now). This affects people's opinions about the app, and our poll is suddenly all stale and obsolete, right? Well, no. Someone goes and edits the CW answer to mention this key fact. It gets votes from new users and moves higher in the list. Those who don't like the new version of the app can change their former upvote to downvote. (Ok, this Chrome example is suboptimal; maybe I'll come up with a better one later.)</p>\n\n<p>Such adaptation to changed world will always take <em>some</em> time, but in the bigger scheme of things it doesn't matter. Like Wikipedia, these things can mostly be self-healing and self-updating if you just let them (i.e. don't lock them!) and if you do just a little bit of curating every now and then.</p>\n\n<h2>Examples of great poll questions</h2>\n\n<p>Finally, for reference and as examples, below are links to some <em>good</em> polls.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>SF: <a href=\"https://serverfault.com/q/3780/1746\"><strong>Useful Command-line Commands on Windows</strong></a> – Nice showcase of a well-executed poll. </li>\n<li>Apple SE: <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/400/150\"><strong>Mac OS X hidden features</strong></a> – I'm happy that <a href=\"http://twitter.com/spolsky/status/24493360648\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Joel seems to appreciate</a> a good poll (and sees their value in promoting SE), even if <a href=\"https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/57226/56285\">Jeff is still against them</a> almost categorically.</li>\n<li>SU: <a href=\"https://superuser.com/q/1241/2984\"><strong>“Must have” Windows programs?</strong></a> – Shame that it's been <a href=\"https://meta.superuser.com/q/915/2984\">\"killed\" by locking it</a> for no good reason at all. :-(</li>\n<li>SO: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/101268/\"><strong>Hidden features of Python</strong></a> – Considered useful by <em>many</em> people, as you can see.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That last one boasts a new (to me, at least) feature:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>protected</strong> by Will♦ Jul 16 at 2:54</p>\n  \n  <p>This question is protected to prevent\n  \"thanks!\", \"me too!\", or spam answers\n  by new users.

Imagine the user who will never read your FAQ and you have two seconds to grab their attention. It should be catchy but descriptive.

Mmmm…whipped cream. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Use it as a Tagline</h2>\n\n<p>A shorter elevator pitch <em>can</em> be used as a tagline&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;something you can display in the header at the top of the page. If it doesn't fit, consider shortening it or creating a separate tagline. Here are some great examples: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://slashdot.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Slashdot</a>: News for nerds.

Maybe the tagline inspires the logo; Maybe it's the other way around. Mottos make good t-shirt, bumper stickers, and other marketing material. Either way, you'll recognize a good motto when you see it: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Just do it. </li>\n<li>Think Different. </li>\n<li>The Uncola. </li>\n<li>Intel inside. </li>\n<li>Like a rock. </li>\n<li>The king of beers. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&hellip;and perhaps all this leads to a proper name and domain for your site&hellip; <em>eventually</em>.

Of course Powerbook should be there too, but old models will definitely get less questions. </p>\n\n<p>All other variants (size, etc.) should be grouped into synonyms. </p>\n\n<p><strong>And Unibody stuff?</strong>\nUnibody <em>should</em> be its own tags. Mac-minis are unibodies too, so that’s an <em>additional</em> and <em>distinctive</em> feature of a particular model. There are Macbook Pros and Unibody Macbook Pros. The tag should exist as such. </p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, (to repeat myself) the current Apple models (macbooks) are more or less the same and a problem that exists on a Macbook Pro 15’’ will probably be the same on a 17’’ model and if not, my idea is that Tags are not the right tool to differentiate <em>that</em> particular aspect of the question. </p>\n","OwnerUserId":"115","LastActivityDate":"2010-11-18T22:10:22.337","CommentCount":"2"},{"Id":"182","PostTypeId":"1","AcceptedAnswerId":"183","CreationDate":"2010-11-18T22:38:06.220","Score":"1","ViewCount":"116","Body":"<p>Obviously this belongs on <a href=\"https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/\">https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/</a> instead of here, but I can't ask a question there without a 5 reputation here on <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/\">https://apple.stackexchange.com/</a> first!</p>\n\n<p>When I created my account here, I linked it with my other StackExchange accounts (15 others).

Either there's a bug, or there has been a change in what questions contribute towards that figure.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming there's a bug, though, we still only have 12.8 questions per day, so we still need to get that ramped up - we're about 300 questions short right now.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> We've passed 1500 questions and are now at 3 \"excellents\":</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/P6Y6c.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>Also of note, we've crossed over 2k visits/day and we have 38 more users with 200+ rep and 2 more users with 2k+ rep.
