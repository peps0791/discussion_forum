The other changes are minor, mostly text and link colors changes to go with the new lighter background color.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few reasons why I made the design changes:</p>\n\n<p>1) The old 2-tone background design was pretty painful to implement in CSS. I had to write a lot more extra CSS hacks to get the pages to look right. Even then, some pages still didn't look nice because of the HTML structure. The old design caused the CSS file to be very bloated and hard to maintain, also it's not easily adaptable for new site features/pages in the future.</p>\n\n<p>2) In the old design I used quite a bit of CSS3 elements for the parent container, this caused some browser performance issues(namely scrolling smoothness in Firefox and Safari).</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Deegp.png\" alt=\"OSX Lion UI inspirations\"></p>\n\n<p>3) The old design was inspired by iOS Apps look. After the site launched, I felt the dark backgrounds made the site a bit too boxy. Dark trims work on an iOS device because screen size is fixed. I've been looking at the new OSX Lion UI elements and I think they're better fitted for a web site design. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, the new changes may have produced a few newer glitches. Mostly likely text colors. Please let me know if you see any(start a new post please). </p>\n","OwnerUserId":"6","LastActivityDate":"2011-05-03T02:45:25.437","Title":"Some design changes","Tags":"<discussion><design>","AnswerCount":"2","CommentCount":"5","FavoriteCount":"1"},{"Id":"461","PostTypeId":"2","ParentId":"309","CreationDate":"2011-04-01T22:06:26.487","Score":"2","Body":"<p>The \"Lion\" redesign removed a lot of the weirder CSS3 on this site; see if that helps!</p>\n","OwnerUserId":"101","LastActivityDate":"2011-04-01T22:06:26.487","CommentCount":"1"},{"Id":"462","PostTypeId":"2","ParentId":"460","CreationDate":"2011-04-01T23:10:29.830","Score":"1","Body":"<p>Generally I really like it!

(If you've hung around Stack Overflow enough, I'm sure you've seen this happen many times.  And I would bet that non-programmers are even more susceptible to this bias.)  Even though I <em>knew</em> there were major problems with the answer, I still felt bad downvoting it -- mainly because it was long, and it was clear the author spent a decent amount of time on it.</p>\n\n<p>There is also the fact that, given the relatively small population of users on Ask Different, it is not common for even a <em>great</em> answer to get 4 upvotes in a matter of hours.

We talk about the current trends of shipping software digitally, the shrinking physical software selection in Apple retail stores, and how you <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4399\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">install Mac OS X on computers devoid of an optical drive</a>. Adding to this that <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id422352214?mt=12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Xcode</a> and the <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/devcenter/mac/index.action\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Developer Previews of Lion</a> are distributed via the Mac App Store, we consider how Apple may distribute Lion officially, possibly announcing it this summer at WWDC.</p></li>\n<li><p>Our Question of the Week is “<a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/14013/is-there-a-way-to-password-protect-individual-apps/\">Is There a Way to Password Protect Individual Apps</a>”, asked by <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/698/rabskatran\">Rabskatran</a>.

That means that you now have the choice to use a Google, Facebook, other OpenID provider to login, or create a traditional e-mail and password login, in order to have your OpenID hosted by Stack Exchange. We also discuss the strict requirements that Stack Exchange places on the password for an account. We debate whether or not they are necessary or reasonable, and how they compare with the practices of both other sites and users.</p></li>\n<li><p>With WWDC around the corner, Kyle brings us another piece of site news: the unofficial Stack Exchange WWDC meetup. Any developers who use Stack Exchange should drop by Eddie Rickenbacker's on June 7th. <a href=\"https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/533/unofficial-stackexchange-wwdc-meet-up-7th-june-2011\">Click here for more info</a>.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>On a related note, as none of us can make it to WWDC, we put forth a request: We would love to have someone who goes to WWDC be present on a show to talk about their experience. If you’re interested, please send us an email at podcast@askdifferent.net.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Moving to news, we bring you an update about the new iMacs’ hard drive temperature sensor update. We share two apps, <a href=\"http://www.hddfancontrol.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HDD Fan Control</a> ($10) and <a href=\"http://www.eidac.de/?p=134\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">smcFanControl</a> (free) that regulate the iMac’s fan speed so that you can use a third-party hard drive without listening to constant, unnecessary fan noise.</p></li>\n<li><p>We discuss the current state of Apple hardware and what refreshes should be on the horizon. For one, we expect to see Thunderbolt make its way onto many of the Apple machines that do not yet support it. Macrumors.com <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/2011/04/21/apple-developing-narrower-rackmountable-mac-pro-prototypes/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">predicts that</a> the Mac Pro will be updated with a rack-mountable form factor, and we expect it to have multiple Thunderbolt ports. Will the inclusion of Mac OS X Server in Lion mean a refresh for the Mac mini server and increased server-oriented capabilities on the Mac Pro? Will the plastic MacBooks be discontinued altogether?</p></li>\n<li><p>In other news, the Mac security world has been shaken up these past few weeks by a new Mac trojan called MacDefender, which is one of the first major pieces of malware written for the Mac. We talk about how one can become infected, what the malware does, and how to remove it, and we discuss Apple’s  promised upcoming software update that will eliminate this particular threat. With that in mind, we discuss the state of Mac security and where it may go in the future. Will the App Store become, by default, the only way to install software on your Mac? Will Apple continue protect us from threats with software updates?  </p></li>\n<li><p>Apple is celebrating their 10th anniversary of the opening of Apple Retail Stores. In doing so they’ve <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/22/apple-store-celebrates-10th-anniversary-with-2-0-experience-ipa/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">rolled out some very significant upgrades for their stores</a>. Almost all paper in the store is gone, replaced by a fleet of iPads. iPads are placed next to every hardware product in the store (yes, even iPads) in order to serve as an interactive kiosk for product information, and for a few personal store functions. This spurns a longer discussion on how a similar system would benefit another type of business.</p></li>\n<li><p>Amazon has announced and released the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/m2VSWB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mac Download Store</a>. Amazon’s store features many key retail titles for immediate digital download, similar to the Mac App Store. The difference is that everything takes place through amazon.com in any web browser, then a tailored Amazon software downloader manages retrieving and installing the software after purchase. Amazon’s store features Microsoft Office for Mac, much of Adobe’s Creative Suite (individually packaged), and more.</p></li>\n<li><p>Our main topic is the pending litigation between <a href=\"http://www.lodsys.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lodsys, LLC</a>, and various iOS app developers. In the past two weeks, Lodsys has sent infringement claims to iOS app developers such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jamesthomson\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">James Thompson</a> of <a href=\"http://www.pcalc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pCalc</a> fame, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mccarron\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Patrick McCarron</a> of <a href=\"http://www.mobileage.com/products/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mobileAge</a>, that due to their In-App Purchase system, they are legally obligated to pay 0.575% of their revenues to Lodsys.

We discuss responses we’ve heard in the Mac Development Community, our feelings on whether developers should pay or not, and our considerations on how this may affect iOS development down the road.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Our Question of the Week is <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/14215/great-apple-first-and-third-party-accessories-or-peripherals\">Great Apple (first and third-party) Accessories or Peripherals</a>, asked by <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/4160/steve-moser\">Steve Moser</a> on May 16.

We discuss how we feel about Apple's shift away from the mouse and if it means that desktop Macs will be sold with trackpads instead.</p></li>\n<li><p>Based on the successful iOS App Store, the Mac App Store has proven to be a big hit with Mac users. We discuss new App Store features in Lion and highlight the success that apps like <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixelmator/id407963104?mt=12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pixelmator</a> have had in the store.</p></li>\n<li><p>Following up on our <a href=\"https://apple.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/517/podcast-2-rim-playbook-continuous-client-coda\">earlier discussion</a> of the idea of the <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2010/05/26/a-modest-proposal-the-continuous-client/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Continuous Client</a>, we discuss how it ties in with Lion's upcoming support for saving and resuming app state, autosave, and versioning of files.</p></li>\n<li><p>We wrap up our discussion of Lion by talking about AirDrop, a way to drag and drop files from one Mac to another without needing to configure file sharing, and the \"iPadification\" of the new interface for the Mail app.</p></li>\n<li><p>Apple also previewed some new features of the next version of iOS, iOS 5, starting with a completely redesigned notifications interface. We discuss what's different and how it makes it easier to read and manage multiple simultaneous notifications.</p></li>\n<li><p>Twitter is now deeply integrated into iOS, and features a single sign-on area in the settings. We discuss what this means for Twitter, third-party Twitter clients, and the conspicuous absence of Facebook.</p></li>\n<li><p>Mobile Safari has also seen multiple improvements, including a tab bar and an <a href=\"http://www.instapaper.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Instapaper</a>-like Reading List feature. There's also a new to-do list app called Reminders. We discuss whether the tab bar was a good idea and the usefulness of location-based reminder alerts.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Camera app has undergone significant improvement. We talk about the faster loading time, the ability to quickly take a picture without having to unlock your device, and how the volume button has even been configured to act as a shutter button!</p></li>\n<li><p>The requirement to activate an iOS device through iTunes will soon be a thing of the past - iOS 5 has cut the cord and is PC-Free. We discuss what the benefit is, and how iOS has made it possible.</p></li>\n<li><p>Apple has brought its Messages app to the iPad and iPod touch, and they've renamed it... iMessages? Yes, it's true - we discuss use cases, the similarity to <a href=\"http://us.blackberry.com/apps-software/blackberrymessenger/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Blackberry's BBM</a> service, and cringe at how bad the name is.</p></li>\n<li><p>Move aside Mac, Apple has re-envisioned the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9046oXrm7f8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">digital hub</a> and it now centers around iCloud. <a href=\"http://www.me.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MobileMe</a> is being phased out as well, and the Contacts, Calendars, and Mail services are being absorbed into iCloud.</p></li>\n<li><p>iCloud also offers a cloud-based backup service for iOS devices, allowing users to back up and restore without ever needing to involve a computer. We discuss the benefits of this, and the limitations Apple has placed on it.</p></li>\n<li><p>Purchases made through the App Store, iBooks Store, and iTunes Store are catalogued in one place and can be downloaded and re-downloaded to all the devices on your Apple account. We discuss our disappointment at the lack of a facility to stream music, and how the new price point - <em>free</em> - is sure to drive adoption.</p></li>\n<li><p>One More Thing... iTunes Match. For $24.99/year, you can have iCloud scan your iTunes library for music that had not been purchased through the iTunes Store. If the iTunes Store carries the file, you will be upgraded to a high-quality version. If not, iTunes will upload it to iCloud and offer the standard iTunes in the Cloud services for that music. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This episode was recorded on <strong>Monday, June 6th</strong>.

Not to mention the active discussion we had with our fellow <a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/38/ask-different-chat\">Ask Different chatters</a>. We discuss the act of covering the keynote, or more specifically attempting to keep up with the coverage across at least 4 or 5 websites, and keeping up with all of the details flowing continuously for over 2 hours straight. We also delve into what we expect to see as all the new features begin to release, and where we would like to see as time goes on.</p></li>\n<li><p>On Tuesday, Steve Jobs presented the next major architectural work by Apple to the Cupertino City Council. We discuss the so-called “Apple Mothership” building to be worked on for the next 4 years and the consideration that is sorely lacking in too many other architectural endeavors.</p></li>\n<li><p>We know that as part of iOS 5, Apple will make Twitter functionality a first-class citizen with pop-overs including location sharing, single sign-on functionality, and a dedicated Twitter account field in Contacts. What we have recently learned is that additional social networks will become first class citizens and be added as contact fields in the Address Book.</p></li>\n<li><p>Yet another iOS 5 feature has received more details: Wireless iPad 2 Mirroring via AirPlay. We discuss the possibilities of utilizing an Apple TV in a conference room in order to simplify the process of presentations, and how to immediately greatly improve the quality of presentations, notes, and interactivity.</p></li>\n<li><p>Continuing with the WWDC hangover, we discuss the state of launcher applications, and the possibilities after Lion’s release and official debut of Launchpad. We contrast the functionality offered by Apple, and the workflow exposed by launcher apps such as QuickSilver, Alfred, and LaunchBar.</p></li>\n<li><p>Our Question of the Week is <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/15624/upgrade-personal-iphone-to-ios-beta-5-0\">Upgrade personal iPhone to iOS beta 5.0?</a>, asked by <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/218/senseful\">Senseful</a> on June 9. We discuss if they (or you!) should, or should not, and lament that we are not more involved in the Apple Development Community in order to make the leap ourselves.</p></li>\n<li><p>Our App of the Week is <a href=\"http://www.acqualia.com/soulver/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soulver</a>. Soulver is a new kind of calculator. Soulver is quick, smart, clear, and flexible. Instead of making a digital analog to a standard desk calculator, Soulver allows you to write calculations as a document, each calculation allowing you to represent a specific part of the entire series of calculations. Soulver is available for <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/soulver/id413965349?mt=12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Desktop Macs</a> on the Mac App Store, and for <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/soulver-for-ipad/id371982536?mt=8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">iPad</a> and <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/soulver-notepad-calculator/id348142037?mt=8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">iPhone</a> on the iTunes App Store.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This episode was recorded on Sunday, June 12th.

And for those who don’t like being tracked across the Web, we recommend <a href=\"http://www.ghostery.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ghostery</a>, a free browser extension to notify you of such tracking, and optionally block it. <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jeoacafpbcihiomhlakheieifhpjdfeo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Disconnect</a> is another option for Chrome users.</p></li>\n<li><p>We discuss the increasing importance of a having a good password on your Apple account. As Apple begins tying more and more to this account, especially with the introduction of iCloud, it is more important than ever to have a secure password on your Apple account. We then discuss the limitations of entering strong passwords on mobile devices, and things Apple could do to make it easier to be more secure.</p></li>\n<li><p>Moving back to Facebook, we discuss the recently-discovered <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/15/facebook-project-spartan/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Project Spartan</a>.

I had done some work, but it was a lack of people resources that kept me from getting too far, so I put everything down and went forward with more stable ventures.

Using FCP compared to iMovie is a completely different mindset, one where I actually felt overly-guided in iMovie.

It's an interesting point, and I have been wondering just how valid that really is.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, I would like to give this a go, should I qualify.

But if I edit your question (or a question you've already edited) and you don't agree with the changes I've made, please feel free to roll them back. </p>\n\n<p>I won't be editing questions here in meta, but I will be dropping in now and then to say hi and see what's going on - so feel free to let me know if you have any questions (or concerns, or complaints, or if you're wondering what I had for lunch yesterday, or whatever)!</p>\n\n<p>Little update:<br>\nWhile I'm actively editing titles (usually for a few hours at a time during the US East Coast work day), I generally hang out in the <a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/38/ask-different-chat\">Ask Different Chat</a>. It's probably your best bet if you want to get in touch with a CHAOS person and grill me about what we do. Or distract me from endless title editing. (Seriously, we're each working with a list of 1000 questions. Chat-related distractions would be heartily encouraged!)</p>\n","OwnerUserId":"7749","LastEditorUserId":"7749","LastEditDate":"2011-07-29T01:03:55.187","LastActivityDate":"2014-04-23T08:48:43.713","Title":"Who is this character with the Ψ and the ♦, running around editing all these posts?
