Asking how to read certain authors' books in iBooks is illegal in some parts of the world.

As a matter of style, I prefer a title lable rather than a complete sentence, but I do recognize that some estemed members of this site encourage complete sentence titles (even if they themselves occasionally use label phrases rather than complete sentences). I think a fuller label is preferable, but don't particularly want the title of the the question to be a complete, gramatically correct question.</p>\n\n<p>If we take as given that my preferences are ideosynchratic (or wrong) and that \"How do I\" is, in fact, better than \"How to\" in question titles, the next question is whether this is a sufficiently substantial edit to merit editing a post. I would again argue that the answer is no: if, in the course of making other substantive edits to a post, one also wants to trivially improve the title, go ahead, but it is certainly not sufficient to cross the \"substantial\" bar necessary to justify editing.</p>\n\n<p>Next, I believe, there is the question of whether a large string of such edits in a short period of time is ever in order. I would most emphatically assert that this is not good for the site. To have the home screen full of questions brought to the surface for a three character edit, thus drowning out the newly asked questions is the very definition of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_%28Monty_Python%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">spam</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I would say it would be my preference to take this one step further: not only should one <strong>not</strong> change \"how to\" to \"how do I\", but <strong><em>any</em></strong> edit that merely changes a clear title into a complete sentence question and does nothing else to clarify the title and contains no substantive edits to the content of the post falls into the category of \"too trivial\" to deserve an edit. Such edits, I believe, should be avoided.</p>\n","OwnerUserId":"9388","LastEditorUserId":"9388","LastEditDate":"2012-02-17T20:26:42.860","LastActivityDate":"2012-02-17T20:26:42.860","CommentCount":"1"},{"Id":"1046","PostTypeId":"2","ParentId":"1042","CreationDate":"2012-02-03T11:28:22.287","Score":"6","Body":"<p>In my opinion, if an edit improves a question in some way, and someone's willing to make it, they should feel free to make the change. Whether this is fixing a typo or retagging the question, the accumulation of all these tiny improvements will lead to a higher quality post, and a higher quality site.</p>\n\n<p>I also think that, the majority of the time, a question's title should also be a question, as it helps the person asking the question to identify the core focus of their problem, which in turn helps the people looking at the recent questions list get a better idea of what the questions in the list are asking. For people with the same problem in the future, the similar questions search in the \"Ask Question\" page is based off question titles, and the title is placed in the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> of the page, which is given additional weight in a Google search. Finally, having the majority of the posts on the site phrased in the form of a question serves to improve consistency, as well as to serve as an example to new users of how to ask their questions.</p>\n\n<p>That said, simply changing \"How to\" to \"How do I\" long after the question is asked and answered really only serves that last point as it didn't help the asker, the answerers, and provides no additional keywords for searchers. Still, I don't think that anyone's arguing that changing the title is bad if there's other stuff that needs to be changed in the body and tags of the question as well, which indicates that an edit that changes the title from \"How to\" to \"How do I\", taken by itself, is at least not a negative.</p>\n\n<p>The point of contention comes with the fact that there's also a 'cost' to each edit - every time a question or answer is edited it's put back at the top of the active queue, the default sort order for the front page. If lots of edits are done in quick succession, they drowned out the actual open questions making it harder to get questions answered, and to find questions to be answered.</p>\n\n<p>The correct solution to this, in my opinion, is to build in support for non-bumping edits into the system. Wikipedia is a good example here - nobody gets chastised for fixing typos, and there's a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help%3aMinor_edit\" rel=\"nofollow\">way to mark edits as 'minor'</a>, indicating that the edit does not change the content and does not need to reviewed.</p>\n\n<p>Barring that, however, I agree that edits to older posts should be done no more than a few at a time, and that it's better to use those edits to fix up the posts that really need it rather than to change something minor. I disagree, however, that any edit that improves the post should not be made because it's 'too minor'. The quantity and frequency of the edits is the problem, not the fact that they change comparatively little.</p>\n","OwnerUserId":"13","LastActivityDate":"2012-02-03T11:28:22.287","CommentCount":"2"},{"Id":"1047","PostTypeId":"2","ParentId":"1038","CreationDate":"2012-02-03T11:43:11.420","Score":"2","Body":"<p>Before I seem like I'm completely against this idea, let just start by saying that I have no problem with our site expanding its focus to include iTunes Connect.

My participation is particularly low except for a few 'hot button' topics that are not just confined to Ask Different.

Participating there helps, though not required.</p>\n\n<p><strong><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9bb29ef7c65ae04b3a8a98ea1c481db9?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG\" alt=\"bmike\"> <a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/12928/bmike\">bmike</a> <a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/3310971#3310971\">answered</a>:</strong>  Yes - this actually is a critical aspect to the site.

Consider the existance of the following tags:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lion </li>\n<li>Lion-Server</li>\n<li>OSX</li>\n<li>OSX-server</li>\n<li>OSX-Lion</li>\n<li>OSX-10.7</li>\n<li>10.7</li>\n<li>10.7.2</li>\n<li>MACOS</li>\n<li>MACOSX</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I could ask a question that I could apply each of those tags to if I had a 10.7.2 Lion Server (and I do...), but let's face it most will just pick one, it's (likely) not synonymed properly and as such we have several competing tags all creeping up to the badge tag required count which would likely all exceed it if consolidated.</p>\n\n<p>So, in summary, I don't necessarily agree with point 1, point 2 was answered elsewhere (they are automatic on count), and 3 would be good but won't be a panacea.</p>\n\n<p>While we are talking about improving the tag system, then in addition to your suggestions, I would suggest a way of selecting a tag from a list, and then be able to dynamically filter a list based on whether the chosen tag is a master <em>or</em> synonym as an aid to being able to select a group of tags and investigate their current synonym structure, which is almost impossible except as a manual endeavour at present (you can only type one filter).</p>\n","OwnerUserId":"9495","LastActivityDate":"2012-02-15T15:01:35.037","CommentCount":"2"},{"Id":"1108","PostTypeId":"2","ParentId":"1048","CreationDate":"2012-02-15T15:48:56.600","Score":"2","Body":"<p>From Meta: <a href=\"https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/67397/159930\">List of all badges with full descriptions</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <h2><a href=\"https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/68395/159930\">Tag badges</a></h2>\n  \n  <p>[…] When a user meets the requirements for a tag badge that has never been awarded, the system creates and awards it automatically.

Also, if you do want to be on the list, please make sure your twitter handle is in your user profile.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!  </p>\n","OwnerUserId":"13125","LastEditorUserId":"13125","LastEditDate":"2012-02-22T22:28:52.433","LastActivityDate":"2012-02-22T22:28:52.433","Title":"Assembling a Twitter list of Ask Different users","Tags":"<discussion>","AnswerCount":"1","CommentCount":"6"},{"Id":"1132","PostTypeId":"2","ParentId":"1131","CreationDate":"2012-02-21T18:54:32.480","Score":"6","Body":"<p>I would welcome a more formal way to access this information than the existing <a href=\"http://data.stackexchange.com/apple/queries\" rel=\"nofollow\">data.stackexchange.com</a> dumps which seem to access a several weeks old dump of the user data instead of polling things that are active on the profile today or perhaps yesterday.</p>\n\n<p>Twitter has been the de-facto social media account when it was added to iOS 5 and the public accounts of OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion indicate that twitter will also be the \"default\" or canonical social media account for users of Apple hardware and software.</p>\n\n<p>Would this be worth making into a feature request so that Ask Different has a built in way to get at any and all users that have chosen to link publicly to their user profiles here?</p>\n\n<p>The current data query only shows rows where users have the string twitter, and doesn't actually extract the user names or allow a list to be directly constructed without further scraping or data manipulation when querying the database. </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps we should wait for your one-time list and see how useful people find this before asking for code changes to the entire site for one sub-group's desire to have more twitter with our stack exchange.</p>\n","OwnerUserId":"5472","LastActivityDate":"2012-02-21T18:54:32.480","CommentCount":"1"},{"Id":"1133","PostTypeId":"1","AcceptedAnswerId":"1134","CreationDate":"2012-02-22T16:23:32.023","Score":"3","ViewCount":"39","Body":"<p>While my <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/41317/using-software-update-server-without-binding-mac-to-lion-server-domain\">question</a> is Apple related, it is also a question that many users that frequent <a href=\"https://serverfault.com/\">ServerFault</a> and <a href=\"https://superuser.com/\">SuperUser</a> may know the answer to since it is about server administration.
