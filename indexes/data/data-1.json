For questions, following the guidelines in the FAQ and the great subjective questions post will probably keep away the close votes.</p>\n\n<h3>Questions</h3>\n\n<p>Even if someone absolutely loathes the software they're asking the question about, there's no reason the question can't be made objective and the commentary left out. Rants belong on chat, meta, or (sparingly) the comments.  Putting this kind of rhetoric in the question only serves to create a negative atmosphere.  Even if there is a legitimate question hiding beneath the commentary, people tend to see it as a rant and arguments ensue.</p>\n\n<h3>Answers</h3>\n\n<p>I think sometimes a user has a strong opinion about whether a particular approach is the right way to solve a problem, and then they share that opinion as an \"answer\", even though their post is really just criticism of the idea presented in the question.  </p>\n\n<p>Many times I think the information in these answers could be valuable to the topic... but I strongly disagree that just because something is related and provides value that it should be an \"answer\".  </p>\n\n<p>If a post is trying to persuade, it's a comment(ary).  Maybe the comment will change the OPs mind about the issue, in which case the question could be edited.  However, it seems that some people just ignore what the OP wants and post what they think they should want.</p>\n\n<p>For stuff that really should be shared even though it doesn't answer the question, I would say try to fit it in one or two comments first. Use an answer only as a last resort when some information absolutely will not fit in a comment post (or two).</p>\n\n<p>\"I don't think so\", or \"No, it can't be done\" are not answers to a question, and should be comments...  Unless the question is actually something along the lines of \"Can x be done?\", posting \"No\" as an answer without any evidence isn't very helpful IMO.  You can't <strong>prove</strong> a negative, but you can at least provide some reasoning (links, references, alternatives) so it doesn't come off as personal opinion in those cases where it's pretty clear that there is currently no solution.</p>\n\n<h3>Why I think this matters</h3>\n\n<p>I don't want to see negativity seeping into the community.  I don't want to see holy-wars, and I think allowing this kind of stuff to start even at a small level hurts the site.  If people start to get it in their head that their questions will be criticized, they'll go elsewhere seeking solutions.  </p>\n\n<p>Personally, I plan to continue utilizing the answer to comment moderator tool whenever I encounter blatant examples of commentary disguised as answers.  I've actually been pretty conservative about it and left a lot of posts that I think fall into this category but weren't extremely blatant.  It's not like the posts are being deleted, the information is still there.  If the person who posted it disagrees, they can always create a new post that actually answers the question, or flag it for review, post on meta, chat, etc... </p>\n\n<p>As an aside, I have personal experience with <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1588/is-there-are-place-to-report-missing-incorrect-album-art-to-the-itunes-team\">posting commentary as an \"answer\"</a>.  It only succeeded in ticking off the OP.  I quickly regretted posting it in the first place.  My \"answer\" received an upvote, but personally I don't feel it or the reputation I gained from it is deserved.  The only reason I didn't delete it at the time was because I felt it provided some good information related to the topic and it was too long to be a comment.  However, after thinking about it some more because of this topic, I removed it and recalced my own score.</p>\n","OwnerUserId":"26","LastEditorUserId":"-1","LastEditDate":"2017-04-13T12:45:26.537","LastActivityDate":"2011-01-13T23:49:04.953","CommentCount":"0"},{"Id":"257","PostTypeId":"1","CreationDate":"2011-01-14T18:03:47.613","Score":"4","ViewCount":"148","Body":"<p>With our launch (theoretically) right around the corner, we should try and see if we can get the official site launch announced and/or covered.

For new users to the site, the design should invoke that \"Apple\" feeling right away.</p>\n\n<p>I had a great pleasure working with <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/flyosity\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mike Rundle</a>, the talented designer who provided me with the initial mockups.

I'm not sure which one is better, but I am sure that the current implementation in those designs is not very easy to read. \nWe could use something from the Finder itself: \n<img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/AMXfO.jpg\" alt=\"finder\">\nIf anything, the disclose triangles would help.</p></li>\n<li><p>The yellow/greenish/iTunes gradient in the title question: I like it, at least at first. It remains to be seen how would that work for a longer title and/or what happens if it's made a little bit smaller/non bold. I like how it gives the Apple look.

That green might look nice, but has nothing to do there. The orange, blue, black, gray, makes it look too full of colors. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>The design looks neat and even if we don't change anything, it's very nice and I really like it. Would love to be able to \"use\" it to see how it feels. Thanks for including a question where my name appears :)</p>\n\n<p><strong>And where's Apple?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>As pointed by Am1rr3zA, the only caveat is that by \"just\" looking at that, there's no indication whatsoever that this is a place for asking questions about Apple. The cloverleaf is nice, but not immediately associated with Apple (unless you are an Apple user already) but Windows users using Apple products, have no ⌘ in their computers and/or keyboards. Perhaps the mailbox icon could be replaced with a little Apple? ;-)</p>\n\n<p>@Jin, great work. @All of us, gratz for what we've accomplished so far and thanks to @jeff and company for all their hard work.

I know the formatting of the tag-related sections are a bit off, and so are some Moderator pages. </p>\n\n<p>I used quite a bit of CSS3 during the conversion.

Too heavy, too cluttered. I would suggest removing the high contrast boxes around the answers and sidebar. Use a simple light background that differentiate from the \"paper\" texture. Keep all the sweet details in the GUI: the buttons, the tags, the icons, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Typography: I'm really a beginner there, but my feel is that the fonts are \"monochromatic\": the font size is too similar throughout the page. I think the design could use two contrasting types. Maybe one for titles and one for body.</p>\n\n<p>The CC button at the bottom right seems to get far more highlight than it should relative to the rest of the content. I would have imagined it as subdued, flat, and really out of the way (ie. iconic).</p>\n\n<p>Likewise for the logo icon. I like the COMMAND key symbol in the logo, but I feel the extra \"recessed\" border around it makes it heavy and cluttered. A simple drop shadow (basically the inner \"button\" in the symbol) would be sufficient.</p>\n\n<p>The search box top right is a little thin and could use more vertical inner space.</p>\n\n<p>Since the Design is heavily influenced by the Apple GUI, I'll try to find some comparisons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The apple.com homepage: all the background is light (good), so that the main content really comes forward. Here, the main content is boxed into thick contrasting borders which feel really heavy and make it hard to separate the content from the design.</li>\n<li>Note the main box on the apple.com homepage is a lighter color than the texture background, white, no texture. I think that would be best here. It would be a lot easier to read through the answers. It would \"breathe\" more.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Also, use more colour. I think that's an element of Apple's website design: contrasting the colours with the site layout which is essentially monochromatic.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I'm not a designer, and I know it's easier to critique than do it. I appreciate the design work but with the best intentions, I just wanted to point out that the design is, all things considered, less \"usable\" (in terms of readability and conciseness) than the simple StackOverflow design. The ideal design imho would be to stop adding CSS3 cruft and remove things one by one until you get middle way between the sweet OS X inspired GUI, and the simplicity and lightness of the original StackOverflow design.</p>\n\n<p>Designs that <em>I find</em> more readable:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>ProWebmasters : could use a little differentiaton in background, or maybe a nice thin vertical line between body and sidebar, to guide the eye, but otherwise easy to read, which is what matters most on this type of site.</li>\n<li>Game development : use the white background for body text, no boxes around answers (just simple lines, or dotted lines separation)</li>\n</ul>\n","OwnerUserId":"1634","LastEditorUserId":"1634","LastEditDate":"2011-02-09T21:25:34.490","LastActivityDate":"2011-02-09T21:25:34.490","CommentCount":"1"},{"Id":"374","PostTypeId":"1","CreationDate":"2011-02-13T00:32:36.577","Score":"1","ViewCount":"78","Body":"<p>The skin here is really messing with my eyes, and I'm having trouble understanding what I see when on this SE site, when compared to others.</p>\n\n<p>I'd like to request an option to turn off the skin and revert to a default, un-skinned site (maybe similar to the beta sites)</p>\n","OwnerUserId":"3579","LastActivityDate":"2011-04-16T17:41:43.627","Title":"An option to turn off the skin (revert to something like the default \"beta\" skin for sites)","Tags":"<feature-request>","AnswerCount":"1","CommentCount":"0","FavoriteCount":"1"},{"Id":"375","PostTypeId":"1","AcceptedAnswerId":"376","CreationDate":"2011-02-13T18:52:47.607","Score":"4","ViewCount":"58","Body":"<p>I'm confused.

As an example, for our initial launch I posted about it on multiple Apple sites around the internet, Reddit, and Hacker News. I even emailed Lifehacker to see if they were interested in doing it. That said, I think that it's much more important to try and get the community to promote the site. There's only so much a single moderator can do, but if you have a solid core of regular users that can promote the site organically, then there's a much better chance for it to succeed.</p>\n\n<p><strong><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9904b127bff836c939152dcd300ea9ea?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG\" alt=\"VxJasonxV\"> <a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/798/vxjasonxv\">VxJasonxV</a> <a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/596808#596808\">expanded</a>:</strong> @Josh I don't know that I call it a responsibility to bring traffic to the site, but it is commitment to do so.

The SEO for Stack Exchange is very effective, and it's the role of moderators to ensure that the quality of the questions and answers make the SEO successful. Obviously promoting the site in general should be done, but that can be expected from anyone that is a user on the site.</p>\n","OwnerUserId":"1521","LastActivityDate":"2011-03-02T16:32:39.650","CommentCount":"0"},{"Id":"411","PostTypeId":"2","ParentId":"408","CreationDate":"2011-03-02T16:34:00.290","Score":"0","Body":"<h2><em><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3981cd271c302f5cba628c6b6d2b32ee?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG\" alt=\"Tim Stone\"> <a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/166/tim-stone\">Tim Stone</a> <a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/596805#596805\">asked</a>:</em> Moderation requires decisive action.

The theme/color scheme, etc. remained the same.
