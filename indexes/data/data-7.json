On the contrary it means more cleaning up things that users have done.</p>\n\n<p><strong><img src=\"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f9f9c427de3bcdf5d8410ef4d39138a8?s=16&amp;d=identicon&amp;r=PG\" alt=\"bassplayer7\"> <a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/users/33519/bassplayer7\">bassplayer7</a> <a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/8103543#8103543\">continued</a>:</strong>  As part of cleaning up after users, they will learn how things work.

There are never enough people doing it, and it usually comes down to a few good folks slogging away.

Since we want to optimize for questions that allow for (or perhaps even demand) good answers - everyone should be more <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/90704/5472\">interested in fixing the question</a> if that's the real problem. Rather than delete an answer that points out the question needs help, let's use the tools to fix a question or guide someone that is attempting to move the discussion forward and only delete an answer if it truly is not of better quality than the question itself.</p>\n\n<p>As moderators, we try to keep some order in terms of deleting things that are actually offensive, mean spirited or blatant spam <em>(spam - n. advertising that is either repetitive or totally not relating to the question)</em> . And we are also here to ensure that criticism of specific choices or functions is constructive as opposed to be unsubstantiated accusations or blowing off steam at someone else's expense, so be sure to use the correct flag if that's your primary complaint with a specific post.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a great post that should be flagged as not an answer.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MFfyN.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>The only way that would be an answer is if someone asked an off-topic question and we would want a flag on the question since I can't really blame the answerer for a mis-placed question.</p>\n\n<p>Here is what a moderator sees when declining a flag when \"not an answer\" is in play:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yq85f.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>So, as you can see, <strong>even if an answer is totally wrong</strong>, that's <em>not enough for us to delete it in almost all cases</em>. It has to be unsaveable by an edit and we like to see that the bad answer has a down vote or two and hopefully a constructive comment before we like to step in and summarily delete an answer. Even totally wrong answers with a polite, concrete rebuttal is of great use to the community. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Think how many people with a similar wrong answer in their mind</strong> could be helped if we kept all the wrong answers online, searchable, but properly down-voted and explained as to how and why the post is incorrect.</p>\n\n<p>Since our site has so few trusted users, the reopen queue is not maintained well, and when a moderator deletes something, it's extremely rare that anyone will see it, let alone have a chance to fix it.</p>\n\n<p>The next time you flag something as \"not an answer\" - do a check to see if it can instead be voted / commented if the poster has clearly tried to move the discussion forward. Not all answers are right from the get-go, but we need to give new users and the collaborative editing process a chance for some answers rather than just deleting them outright. If a post shows any effort to help others learn, it should not be flagged or deleted.</p>\n\n<p>If you're reading to this point, realize that when you don't comment and don't vote and don't edit before you flag a post as not an answer, you haven't shown any care and just tossed your perceived problem to the moderator team to handle. Moderating is what we signed up to do as volunteers, but the reality is that when 30 flags for NAA lack any effort at community moderation, your flag however well intentioned, can become a problem. </p>\n\n<p>We'd like to avoid patterns of flagging things as NAA without performing any moderation of the posts in question. Try to not load the flag queue with things that you can start to resolve if the community has given you enough reputation to start moderating these posts via vote, comment and edit privileges.</p>\n","OwnerUserId":"5472","LastEditorUserId":"-1","LastEditDate":"2017-04-13T12:45:27.673","LastActivityDate":"2016-08-24T11:09:18.257","CommentCount":"9"},{"Id":"1631","PostTypeId":"2","ParentId":"1628","CreationDate":"2013-02-28T01:42:11.850","Score":"1","Body":"<p>Status aside, I don't doubt that you saw this, but I don't see it, and I doubt you see it anymore either.

If you read the <strong>and it is not about…</strong> this question is very much not a fit for Programmers. It's not a professional programmer asking a question and it is about what language to learn next and what book to read (or what training course to take).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/faq\">Ask Different</a> is for Apple enthusiasts and power users. And the question isn't really about using Apple's iTunes Connect service (or other services) and more about looking for advice on how to become a programmer.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/faq\">Stack Overflow</a> is for professional and enthusiast programmers, people who write code because they love it. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So Stack Overflow seems the perfect place for this sort of question. It's targeted at someone about to embark on being a programmer so the subject matter fits there best. Now, that question wouldn't fly in Stack Overflow for a multitude of other reasons, the first being this part of their FAQ \"what not to ask here\"</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Your questions should be reasonably scoped. If you can imagine an entire book that answers your question, you’re asking too much.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This question as phrased seems to be a great example of asking too much. The OP needs to find a mentor to guide them so that they can learn enough to ask pointed, researched, clear questions about practical, solvable questions that will be of use to the programmer community. The question of what to do next is very individual and primarily opinion-based so all Stack Exchange sites will generally close questions that do not have work done to make their subjectiveness minimized.</p>\n\n<p>Now that I've shared why I feel this general topic is a poor fit here or on Programmers, let's address the next point.</p>\n\n<p>This again is a great example of a question that's too broad that any expert cannot arrive on the site and know what the asker is really asking.

Having an anonymous negative feedback mechanism in place that no one is supposed to use is rather absurd.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, with regard to answers, the downvote button is labeled \"This answer is not useful.\" We discourage people from posting comments like \"thanks, this worked for me\"; rather, we encourage them to simply click the up arrow. Similarly, we don't need a host of comments saying, \"this answer doesn't work.\" Voting communicates information; we don't need to duplicate it in comments.</p>\n\n<p>A downvoted question is more ambiguous: it could mean the question does not show research effort, it could mean it is unclear, and it could mean it is not useful.

Yes, there is clear mention in the setup that a developer happens to be the user, but in the specifics no code (Objective C, Xcode compiling or API) are actually involved in the topic. It is pure terminal commands that are accessible to each and every Mac that ships. You don't need to be a developer to answer the question, you don't need to install Xcode, you don't need anything except for knowing that terminal exists and that Apple's OS exposes hardware details to shell scripters and that the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nm_%28Unix%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">GNU tool</a> <code>nm</code> lets you map the details of a file.  </p>\n\n<p>So, if we are to allow questions about \"homebrew\", \"gcc\", and other open source tools that rely only on the terminal - it seems odd to throw out this question that uses open source tools to look at Apple's hardware. Similarly, you can use command line tools to check GateKeeper status, code signing status, whether the network connection is wireless, ethernet or something else and I see this question as fundamentally about how someone can know what hardware is installed by using OS X to get at hardware details.</p>\n\n<p>I happened to know all this, so I was able to flag this question for re-opening, but I wanted a meta thread to explain the difference between closing something that <strong>we knew as asked</strong> was off-topic versus something that <em>might get edited or answered</em> in an off-topic manner.</p>\n\n<p>Despite all that, this question doesn't have enough details to make it \"system-admin friendly\" in that the specific problem isn't with loading or unloading a <code>kext</code> but with finding an API that's declared in the kernel (totally fine for this site) and looking for the development portal to access that undocumented internal API. (totally not fine for here)</p>\n\n<p>I'll close this again which is what the first moderator did unless it gets edited to be more on-topic for admins as opposed to developers.</p>\n","OwnerUserId":"5472","LastEditorUserId":"5472","LastEditDate":"2013-06-22T23:06:24.180","LastActivityDate":"2013-06-22T23:06:24.180","CommentCount":"1"},{"Id":"1743","PostTypeId":"2","ParentId":"1722","CreationDate":"2013-06-25T09:31:48.623","Score":"6","Body":"<p>Another aspect to consider is whether accepting hackintosh questions helps improve the quality of Ask Different.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the questions I've seen so far fall into the category <em>\"I own XYZ.

It's also an issue with Firefox on Windows.  FWIW, I've also seen this behavior with previous versions of the browser.</p>\n\n<p>And yet: I've only witnessed this defect at <em>Ask Different</em>.  I'm a moderator at the <em>Personal Finance &amp; Money</em> Stack Exchange and spend enough time there and I've never seen this happen at <em>Money.</em></p>\n\n<p>Consequently, I suspect the issue is related to a difference between how <em>Ask Different</em> has been configured/customized vs. how other Stack Exchange sites behave &ndash; or at least, vs. those SE sites that remain plain beta-themed, like <em>Money</em> is, currently.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, on Ask Different, the following link is <em>supposed</em> to jump directly to the anchor for Jeremy&nbsp;Mullin's answer at the corresponding question:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/11105\">https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/11105</a></p>\n\n<p>... But it jumps to the top answer, <em>not</em> the one whose id is in the link.

It jumps to the expected answer, being the one whose id is in the link. See:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wkcYR.png\" alt=\"Expected answer jump within page\"></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>@patrix had commented on this meta question: <em>\"I'll tag it as a bug but I wouldn't bet on it getting resolved.\"</em>  Actually, I hope the difference I've demonstrated above shows this bug has a solution in reach? e.g. Isolate &amp; test the differences between the <em>Ask Different</em> theme and the plain Stack Exchange beta theme.  Create a sandbox instance of Ask Different, and remove/revert-to-plain the customized JS, CSS, and other parts, one at a time, until the issue goes away, identifying the errant part. Then, determine the appropriate fix for that errant part. </p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, perhaps the errant customized part can already be inferred from the debugging information presented in the other answer? Such might be obvious to the developer who did the customization work for <em>Ask Different</em> in the first place.</p>\n","OwnerUserId":"116","LastEditorUserId":"-1","LastEditDate":"2017-04-13T12:45:27.673","LastActivityDate":"2013-08-18T15:34:08.707","CommentCount":"3"},{"Id":"1787","PostTypeId":"1","CreationDate":"2013-08-23T13:26:56.370","Score":"5","ViewCount":"72","Body":"<p>There are dozens of questions on here that have viable answers, yet the asker never bothers to go back and assign an answer to the question.
