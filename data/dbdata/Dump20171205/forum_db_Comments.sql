A stuffing box is a tube, larger in diameter than the shaft, through which the shaft passes.

A [mechanical seal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_face_mechanical_seal) uses precision ground (lapped) faces to provide a seal and a spring to mash those faces together.

Id like to add two items.  First, consider each column of the rotation matrix as mapping a new, moving coordinate system back to the old, stationary system.  For example, the first column is the moving x vector expressed in the stationary coordinate system.  If you look at the right-hand coordinate system picture, and rotate it 90 degrees about z (the thumb), youll see that at that moment it is pointing in the positive y direction of the stationary system.  But the moving y vector is now pointing in the *negative* x direction.

This means they do not scale, stretch, or mirror anything.  Since it is sin and cos functions that model the circular rotations about an axis, you will always end up with a determinant represented as a form of \"sin^2 + cos^2\".  That results in 1.  Think about the process for taking a determinant (top-to-bottom diagonals minus bottom-to-top diagonals is one approach).  In order to get *positive* sin^2 plus *positive* cos^2, there has to be a minus sign in there somewhere.','2016-09-21T16:45:39.753',11125,NULL),(19284,10699,0,'Thanks for the comprehensive answer (and @hauptmechs comment too).

This region actually exists, but its not (h) to (3/4 h), its (1/2 h) to (1/4 h). But the robot doesnt know how full the cylinder is, so it starts cleaning that surface, 0.25-0.5h.
